"[<div class=""qnaBoxTitle""><h1> <!-- -->I believe I need a real estate attorney. I live in a recently got renovated building in New York. There are five</h1></div>, <div class=""qnaBoxFirstChat""><strong> Customer: </strong> I believe I need a real estate attorney. I live in a recently got renovated building in New York. There are five residential units. This is a condo. Those five units are bought and occupied. There is one commercial unit. The Sponsor was unable to sell it and rented it out. There are several code violations with the building minor on the building. And there is potentially major structural issues. Either lied by omission or covered up. The five residential units have hired a structural engineer who will need access to everything tomorrow. The basement has taken on water due to, what we can tell, water, seepage, not properly sealed, grading, not done And more. The sponsor came in and said they would take care of certain things which were Band-Aid fixes. They also said they would take care of the mold, which is quite extensive now. When I asked if they had any experience with mold mediation, they said no. They are now blocking access to the commercial space in which they have a tenant building at a restaurant which they also started doing structural alterations without giving notice to anyone in the building or maybe potentially having permits. We need access tomorrow to the space they are evading us. What can we do?<br/>This is a new renovation. And an old 1907 building. Some of the owners have not even live there a year yet. The rest just a little over a year. I believe it went on the market in the beginning of 2022 there’s a six year Obligation for them to fix any structural issues, etc. There are also pages that they had to sign, I don’t know the name, were they all attest to not knowing about these types of things. On an informal walk-through, the architect told one of the unit owners right away what needed to be fixed and what was not code, not exactly in those terms, but it was clear he knew what was not done and what needed to be fixed by them. We really need access the basement take some water now, and the mold is really spreading. In fact, it has destroyed most of my stuff. I’m very sensitive to mold, but it’s now a building wide issue, thank you for your help. We’re in desperate situation here.</div>]","[<div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionExpert""><p>Hi, I am Janessa and I will be your legal expert assisting you with your legal needs today.

I appreciate your patience.</p></div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionExpert""><p>How's your day going so far?</p></div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionExpert""><p>You're facing a challenging situation with potential code violations in your recently renovated New York condo building. It's essential for you to assert your rights. Considering the Sponsor's refusal to provide access to the commercial space and the pressing structural concerns, you should immediately consult with a real estate attorney. They can guide you on accessing the area, possibly through a court order. Ensure you document every interaction with the Sponsor, take photos of the damage, and gather professional reports.</p></div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionCustomer"">Day is getting complicated. Reading your response now</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionExpert""><p>Does that make sense to you? I will be online throughout the day, so just let me know if you need me. Treat me as your personal legal helper. I appreciate you are allowing me to assist you.</p></div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionCustomer"">it does make sense. It’s complicated because the person giving the runaround to us right now is the tenant in that space. I am sure he will knows what’s going on and he’s blocking. The people from the Sponsor group have been waiting on us and so we just cut them out of the picture because clearly they were not going to act in a code, honoring manner and told us they were going to bring in their own structural engineer, which is just ridiculous.</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionExpert""><p>You're undoubtedly in a tough spot, especially with the tenant seemingly obstructing access. If they continue to hinder you, legal avenues might offer some relief. While the Sponsor group's decision to use their own engineer may not hold up in court, it's crucial to get an independent assessment.</p></div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionExpert""><p>The best part of being a legally qualified is to help people, I appreciate you coming online today and enabling me to help you and I sincerely ***** ***** leave feeling satisfied. Did everything I put above make sense to you, or do you have any areas you would like more information on? I am online often day and night, so don't be a stranger and come back if you need anything at all, best wishes and thank you again.</p></div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionCustomer"">thank you you’ve been very helpful. I have one thing that just happened which is somebody probably the sponsor or perhaps the tenant in their unit went in and try to cover up the mold with spackle. Luckily I have taken pictures and videos from September 30 and a little bit beyond. I’ve heard that this kind of thing does it really hold up in court, that would be them trying to cover up What would be your suggestion as far as this as evidence or whatever. Some people think we should talk to them now about this cover-up and some people on the board think we shouldn’t say anything, but just only to the inspector who is coming Friday. We have gotten the runaround from the tenant Who is renting out the commercial space which they still on. He usually doesn’t do this he’s made himself very unavailable for the inspection and we’ve had to move the date. I am suspicious that there is a communication between him and the sponsor and he’s caught in the middle. We have a video camera that might tell us who did that cover-up. So my questions are is this evidence of their cover-up useful. Should we talk to them about it. And does it matter or should we speak to either the tenant or them about being unavailable for the inspection?</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionExpert""><p>You're in a challenging situation with a tenant obstructing access and a recent attempt to cover up mold. Your evidence of pictures and videos from September 30 and beyond could prove crucial. It's advisable to wait for the upcoming inspection to see what the inspector finds. Meanwhile, maintain open communication with the tenant and sponsor about their unavailability for inspection and the cover-up attempt.</p></div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionCustomer"">OK right now the sponsor has not been informed directly of the date of our inspection. Although they know we’re getting one. We have also had one informal meeting that they have not been invited to regarding this situation. I believe my husband did also not invite the tenant since he’s not a unit owner. Let me know if you think that’s the right way to go. Since they were trying to sneak in their own structural engineer, and had come in for with suggestions of ridiculous fixes and methodology that they have no idea how to execute correctly plus the cover-up I don’t really feel very safe, telling them anything because they have consistently lied to us or invaded us or just left out important facts. Just wondering if we need to let them know anymore than we have before we get the report. Or should we let them know that we saw that cover up</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionExpert""><p>In your situation, it's important to prioritize transparency. Inform the sponsor of the inspection date to ensure everyone is aligned and minimize potential disputes. While the tenant may not be a unit owner, consider sharing information to foster cooperation, even though you have legitimate concerns about their actions. Document the cover-up and share this evidence with both the sponsor and tenant, as it could be pivotal in resolving the issue and determining liability.</p></div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionCustomer"">OK well the tenant knows and now said he will be available Friday. He was evading us and it was supposed to be today and we moved it. I have a feeling that the Sponsor is in conjunction with him and he did the touchup but we’ll see so he isn’t gonna be there Friday and I don’t know if the Sponsor is just going to show up but my husband is an attorney not practicing now and I will let him know this and see how that goes. I would be happy to make the call, but I don’t know if he has to is the president of the condo</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionExpert""><p>You've made progress by confirming the tenant's availability for Friday, which is positive. If you suspect any wrongdoing, document everything, and consult your attorney husband for advice. Maintaining transparency and communication with all parties involved is essential to resolving the situation smoothly.</p></div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionCustomer"">Hello, the tenant is nonresponsive, and the sponsors are nonresponsive or just evading us and telling us they’ll get back to us soon. At this point I just want to know if we have any way to get into the space that we need to look at that you know of.</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionCustomer"">Need to communicate we tried everything and we even rearrange the date. They have multiple people that could get the key.</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionExpert""><p>You're facing uncooperative behavior from both the tenant and sponsors, which complicates your situation. If they continue denying you access, consider obtaining a court order to enter the space. Given New York law, you have the right to access a condo unit for essential maintenance or repairs, especially if you can show a valid reason.</p></div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionCustomer"">How long does a court order take?</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionExpert""><p>It depends on the nature of the case. Thanks.</p></div>]"

The exact timeline can depend on various factors, including whether the occupant is a tenant or a family member of the previous owner.</p><p>If you were living in the property as a tenant, you might have certain protections under the law. In some cases, the new owner may need to provide you with a written notice to vacate, typically giving you a specific amount of time to move out. The specific notice period can vary, but it is usually at least 30 days. It's essential to review your lease agreement and consult with an attorney to determine your rights and obligations as a tenant.</p><p>However, if you were living in the property as a family member of the previous owner, you might have fewer legal protections. In such cases, the new owner may need to initiate a formal eviction process through the court system to remove you from the property. This process can take several months, and it generally involves serving you with a notice to quit and then filing an eviction lawsuit. Again, consulting with a local attorney is recommended to understand the specific legal procedures and timelines involved.</p></p></p></div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionCustomer"">Ok makes sense so I probably have a couple months then? It was my mother's home. But I am caring for the property still and paying utilities and such. The new owner hasn't even met me on the property yet</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionExpert""><p><p><p>As previously mentioned, the timeline and legal procedures can vary depending on the specific circumstances and local regulations. In some cases, the new owner may need to initiate a formal eviction process through the court system, which can take several months. However, since you are caring for the property and paying utilities, you may have certain rights and protections.</p><p>It's important to consult with a local attorney who specializes in real estate or landlord-tenant law to understand the specific laws and procedures that apply in your situation. They will be able to provide you with personalized advice based on the laws in your area and help you understand your rights and options.</p></p></p></div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionCustomer"">Can you tell me what I could do if anything about the fact of that I lost the property due to my aunt, the executor, neglected to communicate with me and sell the home and just let it be foreclosed and sold by the bank? My mother passed 2 years ago and she had 2 years to sell it and instead she left me to try to save it myself by getting a mortgage or paying off the previous mortgage myself? Which she knew I couldn't do and I told her in writing immediately after my mother passed that I wanted to sell the property if I couldn't keep it? I was suppose to inherit it as the sole beneficiary of the estate</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionExpert""><p><p><p>If you believe that your aunt, as the executor of your mother's estate, neglected her duties and caused the foreclosure of the property, you may have legal recourse. In such a situation, it would be advisable to consult with a local attorney who specializes in probate or estate law. They can evaluate the specifics of your case, including any relevant documentation or communications, and provide you with guidance on potential legal actions you can take.</p><p>Potential legal actions could include:</p><p>Breach of fiduciary duty: If your aunt, as the executor, failed to fulfill her obligations and act in the best interests of the estate, you may have grounds for a breach of fiduciary duty claim.</p><p>Mismanagement of assets: If your aunt mishandled the property or failed to take appropriate actions to protect it, you might have a claim against her for mismanagement of assets.</p><p>Fraud or undue influence: If there is evidence to suggest that your aunt acted fraudulently or exerted undue influence over your mother's decisions regarding the property, you might have a basis for legal action.</p></p></p></div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionCustomer"">Thank you very much</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionExpert""><p><p>Does everything I have sent make sense?

Notice from the new owner until the new owner can file for eviction or is it less than 90 days</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionExpert""><p><p><p>Foreclosure and eviction laws can vary depending on the jurisdiction and specific circumstances. In many cases, after a foreclosure, the new owner typically needs to go through a legal process to evict the occupants. This process usually involves providing written notice to the occupants and giving them a certain amount of time to vacate the property.</p><p>The specific timeframe for eviction after foreclosure can depend on various factors, including local laws, the type of foreclosure, and any applicable tenant protections.

After the foreclosure is completed and the property is sold, the new owner must follow a legal process to evict the occupants.</p><p>In terms of the timeframe for eviction after foreclosure in New York, it can vary depending on the circumstances and applicable laws. Generally, the new owner must provide the occupants with a written notice to vacate the property, typically known as a ""Notice to Quit.""

The homeowner is entitled to receive proper notice of the lawsuit and an opportunity to respond before the court enters a judgment of foreclosure and sale.New York law requires that the lender serve the homeowner with a copy of the summons and complaint in the foreclosure lawsuit. The summons and complaint must be personally served on the homeowner or, if the homeowner cannot be located, served by publication in a newspaper.After the court enters a judgment of foreclosure and sale, the homeowner must receive a notice of sale at least 90 days before the foreclosure sale. The notice of sale must be mailed to the homeowner's last known address and posted on the property.If the homeowner did not receive proper notice of the foreclosure lawsuit or the foreclosure sale, they may have grounds to challenge the foreclosure and potentially stop the eviction process. They may also have a claim for damages if their possessions were damaged or destroyed during the eviction process.To challenge the foreclosure, the homeowner must file a motion to vacate the judgment of foreclosure and sale within 90 days after the sale. If the court grants the motion, the foreclosure sale will be voided, and the homeowner may be able to keep their home.If the homeowner's possessions were damaged or destroyed during the eviction process, they may have a claim for damages under New York law.

Please be advised, any advice provided does not create an attorney client relationship and should be considered informational only.</p><p>Sorry to hear about your troubles with the rental, that sounds very frustrating.  Unfortunately, withholding rent is really the best course of action under New York law - but to put things in perspective, this is actually a good thing - a lot of states don't even allow tenants to withhold rent legally.  Instead, they are either limited to fixing issues themselves and deducting the cost from the rent, or in a few states, obligated to pay the rent nearly no matter what and must file suit to recover the paid rent back... which as you can imagine is easier said than done.</p><p>So withholding rent is your best option - you can always file suit for damages to your property, getting your deposit back, and possibly moving expenses/other costs fees, but really the main source of being compensated is the rent amount you are already withholding.</p></div>]"

However, this does sound unreasonable on its face.  If you have a late payment, you should be charged a one-time fee and that should be it.  However, if you are late each month, you should probably be charged a fee each time you are late.

If you did not pay that late fee and it remained outstanding, they may be able to charge you a new late fee for any outstanding balance each month....even if that outstanding balance is prior late fees.

Abuse of Power</p><p>BY KEITH LORIA   <a href=""https://cooperator.com/issue/2008-jun"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">2008 JUNE</a><a href=""https://cooperator.com/category/law-legislation"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">LAW &amp; LEGISLATION</a></p><p>Co-op and condo owners often complain that their board doesn’t do enough, or that the board members aren’t involved as much as they would like in the administration and maintenance of their building. While a disinterested or apathetic board is certainly a problem, going to the other extreme can be just as bad…or maybe even worse.</p><p>Board members who let their power go to their heads can be a liability to their building community on many levels, but of particular concern is a board that oversteps its bounds and intrudes on the privacy and agency of individual residents.</p><p>Understanding the boundaries and limitations of your power is something that every board member needs to realize or else trouble—including legal problems—can result.</p><p>Knowledge is Power</p><p>Balancing what is right and what is expected can be tricky for boards — so much so that sometimes, board members and non-board members alike wonder why people bother to serve in the first place.</p><p>“I always tell my fellow board members and clients that if you’re going to be on a board, you are basically a sacrificial lamb,” says Luigi Rosabianca, managing partner of the Manhattan-based law firm Rosabianca &amp; Associates PLLC. “You don’t get paid for it, but by doing so you are providing a service to your building. It’s not only a way to protect your investment, but also your quality of life—but [board members] have to learn what being on a board means, and not to overstep their bounds.”</p><p>What can a board member really do about an ongoing noise complaint, for example? What sort of majority is needed if a vote in enacted to change something within the condo or co-op? Can a board impose rules regarding security or visitors?</p><p>Questions like these can usually be answered by reading the co-op or condo’s official governing documents, says Al Pennisi of the law firm of Pennisi Daniels &amp; Norelli LLP in Rego Park. “The powers are designated in the corporate documents—the certificate of corporation and the bylaws—and some of the additional powers are listed in the offering plan and amended in the offering plan when it’s a co-op conversion. Primarily, it’s the corporate documents and enhanced by case law.”</p><p>It’s essential that anyone who is elected to their board read and understand what they can and cannot do as a board member.</p><p>“You need to do it with all the knowledge necessary,” Rosabianca says. “The first thing you need to do is read the offering plan or prospectus as well as the bylaws, which very specifically outline what the board’s powers and limitations are.”</p><p>In addition to the documents, a new board member can also get advice and instruction from those already involved in the process.</p><p>“When someone new comes on, they get instruction from owners, management companies and other board members if they aren’t educated about those sort of things,” says David J. Byrne, a shareholder attorney with the law firm of Stark &amp; Stark, with offices in New York and in New Jersey. “In a practical setting, they don’t always read the documents they should.”</p><p>Condos and co-ops have different rules, and their boards have very different powers. Even comparing co-op to co-op or condo to condo will find differences, so just because you served on the board of one building doesn’t mean your current board will operate exactly the same way. Your powers and limitations will be most likely be different on any board you serve.</p><p>“The power a board has in a co-op is different than that of a condo,” Pennisi says. “Co-op boards do have more power than condo boards because they control the use of the apartments, they control the sales and leases where in a condo, the unit owner can sell at his or her discretion. Condo boards have less power but both boards can make and enforce rules and regulation pursuant to the documents.”</p><p>Barging In</p><p>One of the chief complaints among residents who think their board has overstepped its bounds arises when someone—a super, handyman, or other building staff member—enters their home without permission, usually to check out something like a leak or electrical problem.</p><p>“With condos and co-ops you have classic communal living—and with communal living there are certain sacrifices that have to be made,” Rosabianca says. “You are conceding that your neighbors have certain rights to access common elements in the building, and that [building staff] may periodically need to access to your unit.”</p><p>Let’s say there is a leak in unit 4F that will affect the owner’s quality of life downstairs in 3F in not taken care of. If the owner in 4F can’t be reached to let building staff into the unit, it is reasonable to expect that the super or repair person will access the apartment to deal with the situation—with or without express permission from the owner of 4F. Upsetting as it might be to think of strangers entering one’s home without permission or supervision, that access is considered reasonable if it’s deemed necessary under the circumstances.</p><p>“I always use the ‘reasonableness standard,’” says Rosabianca, “which is vague, but most management companies are really well versed and know what to do and what not to do in situations like these. As a rule of thumb, you should ask, ‘Is this in the best interest of the building?’”</p><p>According to Pennisi, co-op documents require you to give the board access to your apartment to make repairs—but that’s not usually the case in condos.</p><p>“If there’s a leak in the walls [of your condo,] they just can’t go in and break the door down,” he says. “It has to be a bona fide emergency. If water is leaking under your door and the super or manager has tried calling you and they can’t get in touch with you, they have right to break in and make repairs. I always tell my boards to bring a witness and go in with a camera and take pictures of what the apartment looked like. Don’t go by yourself in case something is stolen and it’s your word against theirs.”</p><p>Feeling Secure</p><p>Security in buildings has become a tricky issue in recent years, and since most governing documents were written prior to current concerns about terrorism and other threats, boards sometimes enact security measures that some residents feel may go a bit too far. But does having an especially robust security program in a co-op building ever cross the line from “overzealous” into “invasion of privacy?”</p><p>“There could be ‘too much’ security in a practical way or an economical way but not really from a legal point of view,” says Byrne. “The boards probably have a pretty broad discretion to set rules on security, so although it might seem like they are overstepping their power, they aren’t really.”</p><p>Some boards feel it’s necessary to have cameras all over their building, a thorough ID check for all visitors, and building access controls that residents may feel are going too far. Some buildings require key code access or card access, and some use cameras to record people coming and going. While it’s fair to say that most residents get a certain peace-of-mind from knowing access to their building is tightly controlled, others find it intrusive, says Pennisi.</p><p>“People say, ‘You have no right to take my picture coming and going,’ or they object to having their Social Security number used as an ID” Pennisi continues. “But a number of courts have ruled that [building rules] supercede the individual’s right, because [buildings] have the right to know who’s coming and going. You can’t publish their information or show the videos, however. That would be going too far.”</p><p>Keeping Things Personal</p><p>When it comes to what boards and managers can do with any personal information they collect on building residents, civil rights and privacy laws have the final word. In short, boards and management are prohibited from making any of that information public.</p><p>Unfortunately however, “Things happen like that all the time,” says Rosabianca. “People make mistakes …most of the time it’s just errors, rather than fraud. I’m on a couple of boards where they distribute board applications to all board members, and they include a lot of personal details. You’d like to think that your board members are responsible with the information and will shred the information afterwards.”</p><p>If materials are being handled properly, Rosabianca continues, one copy of your personal information should be kept under lock and key at the manager’s office—and no one on the board should be distributing that information, or keeping copies for themselves. Some boards are even policing themselves in this respect by blacking out certain information on sensitive documents they see in the course of carrying out their duties to the building.</p><p>Though rare, there have been cases where board members have—either through negligence or ignorance—acted improperly with building information or money. Michael Crespo, president of Citadel Property Management Corp. in Manhattan, says he recently dealt with an unscrupulous treasurer.</p><p>“We recently had a situation where, in an effort to clear up the books of a building we’d just begun managing, we asked the board’s treasurer if it would be OK to send out two deposit checks that had been collected for [construction] work and move-in fees several years prior,” he says. “The deposits were clearly for a one-time item, and there really was no reason to keep holding on to them—they were just throwing off the balances, and we wanted to clean it up. The board’s treasurer suggested that we do a journal entry and make them ‘disappear.’”</p><p>Crespo says that after explaining that these were real deposits that were owed to shareholders, “The treasurer continued to press the issue and explained that he had done this type of thing at his job all the time. In either case, I explained that we know the difference between correcting a journal entry and sweeping someone’s money under the carpet. Needless to say, the shareholders in question (who were also on the board) wanted their money. We ended up cutting them a check.”</p><p>Power Hungry</p><p>While the vast majority of board members take their position in stride and are solely interested in doing what’s best for their building community, some board members do let authority go their head. Most managers and board attorneys have at least one or two stories about boards imposing ridiculous rules on their residents—regardless of whether they actually have the authority to do so.</p><p>“Boards do sometimes abuse their power,” Byrne says. “I’ve encountered boards that don’t actually have published rules, yet think they do. There are boards that set unreasonable restrictions on things, or think they have the power to charge residents fines when they don’t.”</p><p>Other examples of boards overstepping their bounds and abusing their position include members trying to get family members elected to the board or overseeing applications for people they know, or giving work contracts to friends or family.</p><p>“Those are the type of ‘wink-wink’ things you see,” Rosabianca says. “You really want to avoid these types of conflicts. If you are on a board, you should be above the fold. You shouldn’t be soiling your hand.”</p><p>Keeping a board in check and on the right side of propriety and the law could be something as simple as pointing out that more rules are not always better.</p><p>“We simply like to remind the boards that we deal with that when they implement excessive amounts of rules that infringe upon their neighbors, these rules will often come back to bite the people who created them,” Crespo says. “We’ve seen it time and again: a board puts practices into effect that are very difficult to enforce, and which the very people who implemented them are the ones who end up violating them the most. This is where we like to be the voice of reason. We ask that boards be realistic and use discretion, and ask if they would like these rules enforced upon them.”</p><p>Checks and Balances</p><p>Since board members are elected, building residents really have the final say if they think a board member is abusing his or her power. In other cases, a building’s manager or legal council will usually alert the board if board members’ behavior is heading into dangerous territory and the manager or attorney feels they’re abusing their power as a board.</p><p>“A board can terminate a person or refuse to allow a sale,” says Pennisi, “but they have to act reasonably and within the corporate documents and if they don’t the courts will strike it. Usually the managing agents and their counsel guide them to not go astray.”</p><p>“The best run buildings are those that are the most transparent with nothing to hide,” adds Rosabianca. “I think every unit owner has the responsibility to police their board and if they don’t like what they are doing, vote them out.””</p></div>]"

First, a challenge can be made to the ""face"" of the lien. This is essentially a challenge that something, as written on the lien, is wrong and deficient.</p><p>Second, a challenge can be made to the merit of the lien. This is a challenge that the money is not owed (whether due to payment or defective, incomplete or deficient work). To make this claim, you must force the lienor to foreclose on its lien. This is done through a Lien Law Section 59 Demand (called a ""Notice to Commence Action""). The Notice to Commence Action must be served in a specific manner and in the specific time frame set forth under the Lien Law.</p><p>Lien Law Section 59 says that you can demand that a lienor foreclose upon it's mechanic's lien within 30 days of receipt of a proper written demand. If the lienor does foreclose, then you are involved in litigation and will have to defend yourself but you can now raise the issues about payment and quality of work. If the lienor does not foreclose within the 30 days, you can then commence a special proceeding to discharge the lien for failure to foreclose within the 30-day limit that you demanded.</p><p>Here is a template for what the Notice looks like that you would serve:</p><p><a ""="""" href=""https://www.nysba.org/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=81628"" id=""81628"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.nysba.org/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=81628</a></p></div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionExpert""><p>If you have a follow-up question or I missed one of your questions, just let me know.</p><p>Otherwise, please remember to rate my answer between 3 to 5 stars on your page without any additional costs to you.

How can they prove I didn't pay if they waited over a year to notify me and they renewed my lease??? Am I not to think after all that time that the rent was received? That is really my question. Do they have a right to collect on rent over a year ago without giving me a chance to try and rectify the situation such as if it got lost in the mail or someone in there office mishandled things? I never got receipts from them for this back rent they say I owe. Something doesn't sound right.

Since</h1></div>, <div class=""qnaBoxFirstChat""><strong> Customer: </strong> Second opinion] We live on a private road in the town of Brownville N.Y. and my question concerns maintenance responsibility. Since approximately 2000 we have had a Road Association by agreement of property owners. We have not done anything legally to form the association, however we have collected yearly dues. The dues took care of road maintenance as we have paved the entire road. I retired in 2017 and told the other property owners I would no longer be providing them free snow plowing maintenance during the winter months. Last year we hired a plowing contractor, we have approximately 22 property owners but only 14 agreed to defray the cost which was $3750.00 for the season. Our road is a deeded right of way and there is language that states the party of the first part, property owners are responsible for all maintenance, upkeep and improvements. It also states the party of the second, the right of way property owner is not responsible for any of the above costs. My question is are all property owners equally responsible for maintenance including snow removal and if so can a lien be filed against those property owners whom refuse to pay their share.<strong> JA: </strong> What steps have you taken so far? Have you prepared or filed any paperwork?<strong> Customer: </strong> Only a letter requesting payment for snow removal.<strong> JA: </strong> Have you talked to a NY lawyer about this?<strong> Customer: </strong> Not yet.<strong> JA: </strong> Anything else you want the lawyer to know before I connect you?<strong> Customer: </strong> Will I receive an answer pertaining to New York law or should I just contact a real estate lawyer in NY</div>]","[<div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionExpert""><p>Welcome to Just Answer.

While they do not attend all, every property owner has been represented at least one meeting since the association inception. We have had very good success with road dues collection.

I will be the professional that will be assisting you.</p></div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionExpert""><p>For breach/violation under the lease you would provide 30 days notice and terminate the tenancy.</p><p>“In New York, a landlord can evict a tenant for any number of reasons. However, before the eviction can occur, the landlord must first terminate the tenancy. This happens when the landlord gives the tenant written notice, as required by state or city law. If the tenant does not comply with the notice, the landlord can then file an eviction lawsuit with the court.</p><p>New York laws require the landlord to end a tenancy in very specific ways. Different types of notices and procedures are needed for different situations. This article will provide a general overview of the rules landlords and tenants must follow when evicting a tenant or ending a tenancy in New York.</p><p>It is important to note that eviction laws and rules may be different depending on whether the rental property is located within New York City or outside the city, and whether the property is rent regulated or not. For further information or questions, <a href=""https://www.nolo.com/lawyers/landlord-and-tenant/new-york"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">contact a lawyer</a> or a landlord trade group such as the<a href=""http://rsanyc.net/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""> Rent Stabilization Association</a> of New York City.</p><p>Notice for Termination With Cause</p><p>If a landlord wants to terminate a tenancy early, or have a tenant move out before the rental term has expired, the landlord will need to have cause. <strong>The tenant can be evicted early for a couple of different reasons, including not paying rent or violating the lease or rental agreement. To start the eviction process, the landlord must give the tenant written notice. The type of notice needed will be determined by the reason for the eviction.</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Three-Day Notice to Pay Rent or Quit</strong>: If the tenant does not pay rent when it is due, the landlord can give the tenant a three-day notice to pay rent or quit. This notice will inform the tenant that the tenant has three days to either pay rent in full or move out of the rental unit. If the tenant does not pay the rent or move out of the rental unit, then the landlord can file an eviction lawsuit with the court at the end of the three days (see <a href=""http://codes.lp.findlaw.com/nycode/RPA/7/711"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">N.Y. Real Prop. Acts § 711(2)</a>).</li><li><strong>Notice to Cure and Notice of Termination</strong>: If the landlord wants to evict the tenant because the tenant has violated the lease, the landlord must provide the tenant with two different types of notice.<ul><li><strong>Notice to Cure</strong>: The notice to cure is the first notice the landlord needs to give the tenant who has violated the lease. This notice informs the tenant that the tenant has ten days to correct the lease violation. If the tenant fixes the problem, the landlord cannot take any further steps against the tenant. However, if the tenant does not correct the violation, the landlord can then give the tenant a notice of termination.</li><li><strong>Notice of Termination</strong>: The landlord can give the tenant a notice of termination after the landlord has already given the tenant a notice to cure and the tenant has not complied with it. <strong>The notice of termination will then inform the tenant that the tenancy has been terminated because the tenant failed to correct the lease violation, and the tenant has 30 days to move out of the rental unit. </strong>If the tenant does not move out of the rental unit, then the landlord can begin eviction proceedings against the tenant through the court system (see the New York Courts <a href=""http://www.nycourts.gov/courthelp/Homes/holdoverNotices.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">self-help center for holdover notices</a> and the book <a href=""http://nycourts.gov/courts/nyc/housing/pdfs/Landlordbooklet.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><em>New York City Landlords and Owners</em>, page 8</a>, published by the New York City housing court, for more information).</li></ul></li></ul><p>Notice for Termination Without Cause</p><p>A landlord cannot end a tenancy early without cause. If the landlord does not have cause for an eviction case, then the landlord must wait until the end of the lease or rental period before asking or expecting the tenant to move. The landlord may still need to give the tenant notice, though.</p><p>Month-to-Month Rental Agreement</p><p>If a tenant has a month-to-month lease or rental agreement and the landlord wants the tenant to move but does not have cause, then the landlord must give the tenant a 30-day notice of termination. This notice will inform the tenant that the lease or rental agreement will expire at the end of 30 days and the tenant will be expected to move by that time (see <a href=""http://law.onecle.com/new-york/real-property/RPP0232-A_232-A.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">N.Y. Real Prop. Law § 232-a</a>).</p><p>Fixed-Term Lease</p><p>If a tenant has a tenancy that is for a fixed term, such as six months or one year, and the landlord does not have cause to terminate the tenancy early, then the landlord must wait until the end of the term before expecting the tenant to move. Once the term ends, the landlord does not need to give the tenant notice to move, unless the terms of the lease require the landlord to do so; the landlord can expect the tenant to move out of the rental unit at the end of the term (unless the tenant has indicated otherwise, such as by asking for a lease renewal).</p><p>Tenant Eviction Defenses</p><p>Even though a landlord thinks there is cause to evict a tenant, the tenant may decide to fight the eviction. This would increase the amount of time the eviction lawsuit takes. The tenant may have several valid defenses, such as the landlord making procedural mistakes during the eviction (for example, improperly serving a notice or not waiting long enough before filing the eviction lawsuit). Some other potential defenses include the landlord’s failure to maintain the rental unit according to law or the landlord discriminating against the tenant. For more information on tenant defenses, see <a href=""https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/tenant-defenses-evictions-new-york.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tenant Defenses to Eviction in New York</a>.</p><p>Removal of the Tenant</p><p>It is illegal for a landlord to try to force a tenant to move out of a rental unit. The tenant can only be removed after the landlord has successfully won an eviction lawsuit. Even then, the only person who can legally remove the tenant from the rental unit is a sheriff. <a href=""https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/illegal-eviction-procedures-new-york.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Illegal Eviction Procedures in New York</a> has more information on this topic.</p><p>After the tenant has moved out, the landlord may find that the tenant left behind personal property. Unlike most states, New York does not have laws that tell a landlord how to deal with this property. However, the landlord should not just dispose of the property immediately. Instead, the landlord should notify the tenant of the abandoned property and give the tenant reasonable time to claim it. If the tenant does not claim it within a reasonable time, then the landlord can either sell or dispose of the property. <a href=""https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/handling-tenants-abandoned-property-new-york.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Handling a Tenant's Abandoned Property in New York</a> has very useful information for what to do in this situation.</p><p>Rationale for New York Eviction Rules</p><p>Landlords must carefully follow all the rules and procedures required by New York law when evicting a tenant. Otherwise, the eviction may not be valid. Although these rules and procedures may seem burdensome to the landlord, the rules are there for a reason. Evictions often occur very quickly, with the end result being that the tenant has lost his or her home. The rules help ensure the eviction is justified and that the tenant has enough time to find a new place to live…”</p><p><a href=""https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/the-eviction-process-new-york-rules-landlords-property-managers.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/the-eviction-process-new-york-rules-landlords-property-managers.html</a></p></div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionExpert""><p><a href=""https://www.landlordguidance.com/eviction-notice-forms/new-york-eviction/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.landlordguidance.com/eviction-notice-forms/new-york-eviction/</a></p></div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionExpert""><p>Please do not hesitate to ask me any additional questions that you may have with regard to this matter.

(See<em> Calvente v. Levy</em>, 816 N.Y.S.2d 828 (N.Y. App. Term 2006).) This is a departure from some earlier court rulings saying that there was no remedy for a buyer under the PCDA other than the $500 closing credit for failure to provide the form. However, your ability to obtain damages under the PCDA depends on your ability to prove that the seller had actual knowledge of the defect and did something to prevent you from finding out.</p><p>Notwithstanding your remedy under the PDCA, you still have all of the other remedies available under New York law.

New York case law is state law created by the New York appellate courts. When a judge in one of these courts writes an opinion in a case, the rulings within become law.</p><p>Here are some of the remedies created by the New York appellate courts.</p><p>Fraud or Fraudulent Misrepresentation</p><p>The home seller may be liable to you for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation if you can prove the following elements:</p><ul><li>the seller made a written or oral statement of fact that was false, and known by the seller to be false, or omitted a material fact</li><li>the statement or omission was made, or not made, to induce you to rely upon it and purchase the property</li><li>you relied upon the statement or omission, and you were justified in so relying, and</li><li>you sustained an injury due to your reliance on the statement or omission.</li></ul><p>To prove fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation, you would need to show that you were justified in relying on the seller’s false statement or omission. If, for example, you hired an engineer to make an inspection, but the inspection was inconclusive, a New York court may deny your claim for failure to make a further inspection.</p><p>However, if the seller actively concealed the defect, or if the defect was something only the seller knew about, and you could not have discovered it on your own, even through a very reasonable and diligent inspection, the seller may be found liable. Some New York courts consider false statements in the PCDA disclosure statement to be evidence of active concealment of the defect by the seller. (See <em>Simone v. Homecheck Real Estate Services, Inc.</em>, 2007 NY Slip Op 6224 (N.Y. App. Div., 2007).)</p><p>Breach of Contract</p><p>Depending on the specific terms of your purchase contract, the seller may be liable to you for breach of that contract. To prove breach of contract, you will have to show that the seller gave you a warranty against the defect in the contract, and that the warranty did not merge into the deed (the document that the seller gave you at the closing passing title to you).</p><p>Proving that the seller gave you a warranty in the contract may be difficult because the standard New York purchase contract contains an “As Is” provision stating that you — the buyer — have agreed to purchase the property in the condition it is in at the time of the contract, without any warranties from the seller. The PCDA disclosure statement is supposed to be attached to the contract, but the disclosure statement specifically states that it is not a warranty, so you cannot use the representations in the statement to help you prove breach of contract.</p><p>Even if your purchase contract does not contain the “As Is” language, or includes specific warranties of the condition of the property, these warranties often expire after the closing by their own terms, or under the “Doctrine of Merger,” a general New York law of contracts basically meaning that all warranties in the contract merge into the deed of the property given to you by the seller at the closing. You can avoid the merger if your purchase contract specifically states that all or some of the provisions will survive delivery of the deed.</p><p>Remedies Against the Brokers in the Transaction</p><p>New York courts have also softened the general rule of “caveat emptor” that applies to the seller’s broker or agent, sometimes known as the listing broker. The listing broker, as well as your buyer’s broker, may be liable to you if they knew of a significant defect and failed to tell you about it.</p><p>They could have told you orally or in writing and were not required to provide you with a formal disclosure statement. You'd also have to prove that you did not know about the defect and had no ability to discover it through your inspection or other research, such as by making inquiries with neighbors or the local governing body. <em>See Daly v. Kochanowicz,</em> 2009 NY Slip Op 6232 (N.Y. App. Div., 2009). It is important to note that the “As Is” language in the purchase contract will not protect your broker from liability to you.</p><p>The listing broker also has some limited disclosure obligations under the PCDA, and potential liability to you. If you are not represented by a buyer’s broker in the negotiation of the purchase, the listing broker was supposed to explain the disclosure requirements of the PCDA to you, and may be liable to you for having failed to do that before you signed the contract..""</p><p><a href=""https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/home-defects-new-york-what-can-buyer-do.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/home-defects-new-york-what-can-buyer-do.html</a></p></div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionExpert""><p>You can sue  the seller for fraud and they would need to pay the expense of removal.

Can they do this?<br/><strong> JA: </strong> Has any paperwork been filed?<br/><strong> Customer: </strong> Not that I know of<br/><strong> JA: </strong> Anything else you want the lawyer to know before I connect you?<br/><strong> Customer: </strong> No</div>]","[<div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionExpert""><p>Hello.  My name is ***** ***** I am a licensed attorney.  I hope I may be of assistance with your question. Please remember to rate my service at the end of this session.  Thank you!</p><p>What type of lien has New York State placed on your account?  Is it a tax lien or something else?</p></div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionCustomer"">Child Support</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionExpert""><p>Ok I see.  Did you receive a copy of the Order which stated you owe monthly child support?  Did you receive notice that you were in arrears for child support?  If you did not receive notice for either Order than you may have a claim.  Let's start with whether you have received proper notice.</p></div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionExpert""><p>A levy is a legal order requiring a third party, usually your bank, to remove money from your account and turn it over to the judgment creditor or collection agency that has the judgment against you.  To remove the levy, you must either pay the bill in full or show that the funds in the account are exempt.</p><p>New York is one of the few states that protects your bank account by requiring the judgment creditor and the bank to take certain steps before your bank account can be levied or restrained.   The New York’s Exempt Income Protection Act (EIPA) sets a minimum baseline balance that is not subject to a freeze or levy by the judgment creditor.  This baseline amount is currently set at $1,920 per banking institution.  The protected amount goes up to $2,625 if the account includes directly deposited government benefits and other types of income that are exempt from creditors such as Social Security, unemployment insurance, child support payment and alimony.</p><p>The EIPA also requires the bank to analyze the funds in your account to make sure it does not contain exempt funds.  It also requires the judgment creditor to issue exemption forms to the bank to give to you, and to appropriately address any claimed exemptions.</p></div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionCustomer"">Firstly, I don’t live in New York and my son doesn’t either. He’s 19 years old and hasn’t lived in New York in over 2 years. I did receive a notice of arrears from the state of New York but only a letter from my bank explaining the hold which said nothing about them literally freezing my account. Any deposits going into my account are automatically frozen even though they have more than enough to satisfy the lien or hold.</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionExpert""><p>It does not matter which state you currently live in or where the child lives.  It is a New York child support order so they retain jurisdiction.  If you do not satisfy the amount in arrears, you may challenge the bank for freezing income being deposited into the account.  There are several types of income that are exempt from being frozen:</p><ul><li>Supplemental security income (SSI)</li><li>Social security</li><li>Public assistance (welfare)</li><li>Spousal support, maintenance (alimony) or child support</li><li>Unemployment benefits</li></ul><ul><li>Disability benefits</li><li>Worker’s compensation benefits</li><li>Public or private pensions</li><li>Veteran’s benefits</li><li>90% of your wages or salary earned in the last 60 days</li><li>Railroad benefits</li><li>Black lung benefits</li></ul><p>If a judgment creditor levies a bank account containing exempt funds, you may be able to get the money back.  The court has a free form that can be used for this purpose called an Exemption Claim Form.</p></div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionCustomer"">is it legal for Bank of America to freeze my account even though there’s more than enough to cover the lien? Can they keep freezing new deposits?</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionExpert""><p>Yes they may until you either satisfy the outstanding amount with New York state, receive a court order, or negotiate a settlement with your ex.  They may not freeze any  income that comes from the list above.</p></div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionCustomer"">I see it says 90% of wages earned last 60 days, they’ve actually frozen all my wages that are directly deposited into my account. Also my new wages are being frozen.</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionCustomer"">They have a court order that says to hold Only 9k</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionExpert""><p>You may have an argument to get some of the funds released but I will warn you dealing with Bank of America is a nightmare.  They have a horrible legal department and it takes forever to get things cleared.  You may attempt to go to your local branch in person to try and get some of the monies released but your best bet is to try and get the arrears addressed.  This does not mean paid in full.  It simply means having some sort of agreement in place or settlement that will lift the lien.</p></div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionCustomer"">What allows them to hold the entire balance of my account even though there’s enough to cover the lien? Whenever I speak to them they keep telling me New York law allows them to hold twice the amount yet they’re holding a lot more than that.</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionExpert""><p>They are entitled to freeze double the amount of the judgment.  If they are freezing more than that you may be able to get some of the funds released.  The levy does not go away until the New York Marshal actually seizes the outstanding amount from your account or you satisfy the levy.</p></div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionCustomer"">Do I have a case against Bank of America for any of their violations or I’m I wasting my time? As far as I can see they can get away with doing anything they want with my money.</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionExpert""><p>Yes you may have a claim to have some of the money released.  For instance you said they are holding more than the allowable double amount of the judgment.  It also appears they are freezing income that is exempt from the court order.  The problem is you must go through the Bank of America legal department to have these funds released.  It's not impossible but it is time consuming and frustrating because they are incompetent and do not understand the law.</p></div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionCustomer"">Thanks</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionExpert""><p>No problem!

The landlord is required to provide a safe and quiet environment for a tenant. However, if there is construction noise going on that is outside the control of the landlord, the court will weigh the circumstances to determine a breach of the lease and damages.</p><p>was the construction underway when you signed the lease?</p><p>When is the construction noise - during the day, at night while you are trying to sleep? are you home most days or do you work weekdays outside the apartment? Are there any other tenants in your unit with you, including small children?</p><p>All of these factors will be weighed to determine the extent of the nuisance and your ability to exit the lease.</p><p>If you wish to terminate the lease, the time frame required in the lease (and procedure) should be followed -- 30 day written notice.</p></div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionCustomer"">I live in a brand new apartment building so the lease mentions that there will be construction to a reasonable extent but from October- March I was being woken up various times a week (at 6am) to construction noise on my walls and drilling on my ceiling.  They told me various times the unit next door would be priority and done in a week but the unit next door is still ""almost complete.""  I have a dog in my apartment and my boyfriend.</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionCustomer"">The woman in account management also told me that it cannot be 30 days that I need to give 3 months notice.</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionExpert""><p>I recommend a written letter to the landlord outlining the extent of the noise, your prior complaints, the promise that the work would be done in a week, etc and demand that it cease or that the landlord put you up in a hotel until the work is done. Otherwise, the landlord will be in breach of the lease of the lease - which is constructive eviction and allows you to break the lease and leave.</p><p>Be sure to check the lease agreement for your remedies if the landlord breahes.  You probably are not required to give 3 months or 30 days notice.</p></div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionCustomer"">How do I know if I have a valid case or not? Do you provide a service to review my lease? I read through it and highlighted some key points but I am not a legal expert</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionCustomer"">Is there a way I can negotiate with them to lower the $5,000 fee that they are trying to charge me to break the lease?</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionExpert""><p>If the landlord is in breach -- you are not terminating the lease so no termination fees and no 3 month notice required.  You will need to take the position that the landlord is in breach -- that is the only way to get out of the lease without those requirements.</p><p>can you upload the agreement?</p></div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionCustomer"">I have attached it below.</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionExpert""><p>Give me a few moments to review.</p></div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionCustomer"">Thank you very much!</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionExpert""><p>Here's the operative clause in para. 21:</p><p>Owner will not be liable for any temporary interference with light, ventilation, or view caused by construction by or in behalf of Owner. Owner will not be liable for any such interference on a permanent basis caused by construction on any parcel of land not owned by Owner. Also, Owner will not be liable to You for such interference caused by the permanent closing, darkening, or blocking up of windows, if such action is required by law. <u><strong>None of the foregoing events will cause a suspension or reduction of the rent or allow You to cancel the Lease.</strong></u></p><p>I think you have a good argument that you are not experiencing temporary interference and that it has been permanent interference and noise since you moved in AND caused by construction on property owned by Owner (unit next door).</p><p>The lease does not address the landlord's breach and your remedies.

Long story short, after many attempts of trying to have him send us our security deposit, he's only notified us that we left the apartment with ""severe damages"" and aside from keeping our deposit, we owe him money for the repairs. The ""severe damages"" he's claiming are nail holes which we covered up, and some of the stain from the wooden floors peeling off. We plan on taking him to small claims court, but would like advice on how to go about it or what we'd need to take to almost guarantee we can get our money back. He had cancelled twice to do a final walk-through, during our stay there failed to get certain things done to the apartment, and took over 100 days since we moved out to tell us we owe him money (no bills/invoice sent ever).

"[<div class=""qnaBoxTitle""><h1> <!-- -->After purchasing our condo apartment in NYC in December 2016, we asked our board and management company of the building</h1></div>, <div class=""qnaBoxFirstChat""><strong> Customer: </strong> Hello,After purchasing our condo apartment in NYC in December 2016, we asked our board and management company of the building permission to plaster and paint the apartment. The board and the management granted their approval, did not indicate we needed to take any further steps such as written requirements or written documentation and we began with the work. It is of note that the approval was over the phone and we do not have any written approval from them.Shortly after we began the work, the board sent us a letter from their attorney and stated that we violated the by-laws by conducting work other than the plaster and paintings that are deemed as ”illegal alterations” and they fined us $250 for each day of the work (4 days) plus attorney fees $1600, to a total of $2600.<br/>The attorney quoted the building's by-laws, which says: ""Subject to the term of paragraph (B) of this section 5.2, no unit owner shall make any structural alteration, addition, improvement, or repair in or to his unit without the prior written approval of the Condominium Board. In the event, however, that the Condominium Board shall fail to answer any written, reasonably detailed request for such approval within thirty (30) days after such request is received, such failure to respond shall constitute the Condominium Board's consent thereto.""The Board sent the building's superintendent into our unit to perform an inspection multiple times. In the third time, it resulted in the super breaking into our unit and having the police involved to take him out. This was recorded on video.Needless to say, despite their allegations, no other work was conducted in our unit aside from the plaster and paint and shelf installations on the walls as we had reported. We tried to contact the board numerous times and invited them to our unit to show that no other work other than what we requested was done. However, the board ignored our request and was not willing to withdraw these fines and legal fees.Therefore, we filed a claim against the Board in a small claims court, and intend to represent ourselves without an attorney at court. I wondered what would be the best approach for this issue at court? We don't have a written approval from the board but we have the call log to indicate that we had multiple conversations with the board's president and the management. We also can show all the emails saying that we tried to solve it outside of court and the board ignored us all along.We wonder why would the board rather spend the building's common budget on lawyers and litigations instead of speaking to us or visit our unit? Is there a way to rebuttal the board’s decision to press charges in this way as we see a futile use of common funds?What does the New York law say regarding our rights as unit owners? Am I allowed to paint and plaster my apartment even if the by-laws say otherwise?Would you advise to contact their attorney and offer them to drop the fines and legal fees and in return we would drop the case?After submitting the small claim to invite the board to court, we received a letter from the board’s attorney sent to the court as well - a “motion to dismiss all charges”. The request to dismiss the court claim without appearing in court as the charges are “too vague” and “lacks factual specificity whatsoever”. The letter states we did not provide any facts in the claim submission. However, the facts will be presented in court. At the time of the claim submission, the information we provided was sufficient for the civil court to summon them to court. Is there anything we can do about this response in order for the charges not to be dropped without a hearing? Is the board’s attorney right that the claim is not justified if we didn’t state a fact in the claim? This was not told to us when we submitted the claim to the court. Please note the attorney who sent us the letter knows exactly what fines we are talking about as he was the one that sent us the notice about the fine in the first place.As a reminder, this is a condominium, not a co-op.<br/>Please help, any advise would be highly appreciated.</div>]","[<div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionExpert""><p>Hello and welcome to JustAnswer.

The way litigation works (in real life as opposed to on tv) is you need to present as much evidenc as you possibly can up front so that the other side can't file for summary judgment or file a motion to dismiss on the basis of things like ""not enough evidence"" or ""vague claims"" or things like that. You HAVE TO state a claim. If you don't state a claim there's nothing for the court to decide. I'm sorry, I know I'm not giving you good news but I need you to know how the courts work.</p></div>]"

I'm sorry to hear that this happened.</p><p>Negligence means that you would have done something to require the repair, so in that scenario, it wouldn't matter that it's behind the wall. But that would require proving that you made the pipe fail somehow, and there doesn't appear to be any evidence of that. They'd have to be able to prove that you did something unreasonable in making the damage happen to say you were responsible for negligence.</p><p>Check your condominium documents to see if they specifically define common elements. Typically, pipes that serve multiple units are common elements, where repair and maintenance is paid for by the association. However, pipes that serve only one unit are what's called ""limited common elements."" With limited common elements, although the association is usually responsible for ensuring that a repair happens, they're allowed to charge only the owner who benefits from using that limited element. Which means they'd be able to send you the bill if they fixed it, and you're better off hiring someone to do the work yourself so you can try to keep costs down.</p><p>If that pipe serves more than one unit, <a href=""http://law.justia.com/codes/new-york/2010/rpp/article-9-b/339-i"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">New York law </a>requires you to let them in to make repairs, but it doesn't require you to foot the entire bill or make the repairs yourself.</p><p>If you have any questions or concerns about my response, please reply WITHOUT RATING.

I am selling at a discount because the house is in bad shape and I need the cash.  Seller has cash, and will pay $15K down.  Together we have agreed to a land contract for the balance over 5 years.<br/>My question:  Is it legal to take the $15K now and schedule the closing with an attorney ASAP?</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionCustomer"">That's OK - typing is fine</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionCustomer"">PLEASE DO NOT CALL - Realized too late it was $60</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionExpert""><p>I did not request the call.

I am happy to continue with you in this format.</p></div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionExpert""><p>The land contract you are using should set out the specifics on the down payment.

I realize that's risky form a loss standpoint.

A land contract is a form of  <a href=""http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/seller-financing-home-sales-30164.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">seller financing</a>. It is similar to a mortgage, but rather than borrowing money from a lender or bank to buy real estate, the buyer makes payments to the real estate owner, or seller, until the purchase price is paid in full</p><p>A buyer and a seller both sign the land contract covering agreed upon terms and conditions of the sale. Upon satisfaction of all contract terms and conditions, including payment of the purchase price over a specified time period, the legal title of the property transfers from the seller to the buyer by way of a warranty deed, or other  <a href=""http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/double-check-that-your-home-deed-was-recorded-or-else.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">deed</a>  used to convey title.</p><p>This article discusses the basics of a land contracts including how and when they are used to purchase real property.</p><p>Why Are Land Contracts Used?</p><p>As with other types of seller financing, a land contract may be advantageous to both buyer and seller.</p><p><strong>Benefits to buyers.</strong>  There may be a buyer interested in the real estate for sale but who, because of their credit history or other reasons, cannot obtain approval for a needed mortgage. The parties can enter into a sale by land contract so that the buyer makes monthly payments directly to the seller.</p><p><strong>Benefits to sellers.  </strong>The seller does not receive the full purchase price up front, like the seller would if the buyer used a mortgage or paid all cash, but the seller may have more options for potential buyers. Also, the seller may be able to negotiate a higher purchase price on the property by offering a sale by land contract. The seller may also require and receive a large cash down payment.</p><p>When Does the Buyer Become the New Owner of the Land Contract Property?</p><p>While the buyer is making payments to the seller, the buyer is considered to have an “equitable title” to the property. As an equitable title holder, the buyer has an interest in the land contract property and the seller is precluded from selling the property to a third party or subjecting the property to a lien or encumbrance that would interfere with the buyer’s interest in the property.</p><p>The “legal title” to the property remains with the seller until the buyer makes the final payment. When the final payment is made, and all conditions of the land contract are met, the deed to the property will be filed with the appropriate government office, such as the county register of deeds, naming the buyer as the new owner of the property.</p><p>What Happens if the Buyer Fails to Make the Land Contract Payments Due?</p><p>If the buyer defaults on the land contract, or fails to make the monthly payments to the seller as required, the seller can file a court action called land contract forfeiture. Forfeiture will result in the buyer “forfeiting,” or giving up, all money paid to the seller for the property pursuant to the land contract and the equitable title of the buyer will be extinguished. In other words, if the buyer fails to pay, the seller keeps all money received, plus the seller keeps the real estate.</p><p>The seller takes a risk selling by land contract because the seller does not receive the full purchase price at the time of sale, but a forfeiture right protects the seller from a buyer who fails to pay allowing the seller keep payments and a usually large down payment made by the buyer while retaining the property to offer for sale to someone else…”</p></div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionExpert""><p><a href=""http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/the-basics-land-contracts.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/the-basics-land-contracts.html</a></p></div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionExpert""><p>New York Real Property Law § 461.

I'm sorry to hear about your situation.</p><p>A person who lives in a property without a lease and pays rent is a tenant, not a squatter. That means you have a tenant's rights. Legally, a squatter must not have the permission of the owner to be on the property. A squatter also gains no rights until they've lived on the premises for 10 years without permission, so that unfortunately doesn't help you. But you are a tenant, and you can insist upon tenant's rights.</p><p>Outside of New York City, NY laws requires a landlord to give a tenant at least one month's written notice. The notice must terminate at the end of a month, so a notice given during the month of February would be effective March 31. <a href=""http://codes.findlaw.com/ny/real-property-law/rpp-sect-232-b.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">NY Real Prop. Laws and Rules, Section 232-b</a>. They cannot make you move out in the middle of March. I'm afraid there isn't any right to stay on a month to month lease beyond the one month's notice. You'd have to have a written lease to stay longer. Neither the amount of time you've lived there or the fact that you've helped maintain the place make a legal difference, if you don't have a written contract.</p><p>When a person sells leased property, the lease transfers to the new owner. That means either the new or old owner could bring an eviction suit if you're still in the property as of April 1. Sometimes a seller will delay a closing until a tenant moves out, but you run the risk that the landlord will sue you for expenses associated with the delayed sale if you stay. That could include the cost of having to pay for the buyer to live elsewhere until you leave, which means it could add up quickly.</p><p>Eviction lawsuits are designed to be resolved pretty quickly. It usually takes about a month, although there are things you can do to delay, especially if you're willing to hire a lawyer. A judge has the ability to award you a stay of up to 6 months. This remedy is usually reserved for elderly or disabled tenants, or tenants with small children, but having lived there for so long could count in your favor, especially if you have nowhere to move your horses. But again, you'll have to pay damages to the new owners if you occupy their property, preventing them from moving in.</p><p>I apologize that this was probably not the Answer you were hoping to receive. However, it would be unfair to you and unprofessional of me were I to provide you with anything less than truthful and honest information. I hope you understand.

Thank you.<br/><br/>Good luck.</p></div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionCustomer"">I am occupying the living space in the basement with a separate entrance, which would not prevent new tenants from moving in ! The house is approximately about 5500 sq ft !So what kind of damages could they possible incur ?</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionExpert""><p>If they've already entered a contract to rent the basement unit to someone else based on you leaving, the new tenants who are unable to move into that basement unit could sue for any rent paid elsewhere. Also, if they're rented the entire property to new tenants, then the new tenants are paying for a basement they can't access, and the owners could be obligated to refund them some portion of their rent to make up for the lost space.</p><p>New York law also says that a tenant who gives notice to leave and doesn't can be made to pay double the rent. It doesn't sound like you've promised to leave, but keep that in mind when talking to them.</p></div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionExpert""><p>They will have the burden of proving that they've lost money due to you being in the basement (above and beyond rent, which you'd still be paying).</p></div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionCustomer"">no contract has been signed as of yet !</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionCustomer"">What form of notice to vacate is required by my landlord to me ? Written ,verbal or notarized ?</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionExpert""><p>They're still only required to give you one month's notice. Their right to terminate isn't dependent on selling the property.</p><p>The statute doesn't require that notice be in writing, so verbal is allowed. If they choose to give a written notice, they do not have to notarize it.</p></div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionCustomer"">how does one prove a verbal notice ?</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionCustomer"">they haven't mentioned that they are looking to rent out this space and if I'm willing to pay the rent they wouldn't be out of pocket any funds ?</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionExpert""><p>Their testimony that they gave you notice, given under oath is proof. If you testify under penalty of perjury that they didn't give the notice, the judge will have to decide who is telling the truth. That's why most landlords give written notice, or give verbal notice in front of a witness.</p><p>I can't presume that they won't be out any money if you overstay the notice. There's just no way for me to know what the new owners are planning to do with the property. My job is to tell you what could happen. If they're planning to use or rent the space, you could be liable for damages. If they can rent it out for more than you're paying, you could be sued for the difference.</p></div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionCustomer"">Thank YOU LUCY !!</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionExpert""><p>If you truly appreciate the time and information I have given you this morning, please rate this question again positively or contact customer service to reinstate the rating.

I just signed a new 12 month apt lease. However, I may have to break this lease. I live in NY. The main reason is due to a chronic illness so I need to be closer to the hospital where they can help me. Due to this illness and other medical issues I'm disabled and need assistance from my family who live in NJ. So I need to move. I read that if u are 65 years old, are sick and need assistance from family members, you are allowed to break the lease. I have several chronic illnesses (3 main ones) including epilepsy and an organ transplant. My dad is 68 years old and he is healthier than me, I'm 41 years old. Also, I got a German Shepherd dog as an assistance/ service dog and I keep getting the looks and comments from neighbors and even the Apt complex Mgmt because a lot of people don't understand that not all big dogs bite or are bad. It really stresses me out and it makes me physically sick. Can these be reasons to break the lease earlier without having to pay for the rest of months left unpaid on the lease? I really need help with the issue. I'm not working, I only get Disability and I really need to be closer to the doctors who are experts. Thank you.</div>]","[<div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionExpert""><p>Hi,</p><p>I'm Lucy, and I'd be happy to answer your questions today. I'm sorry to hear about your situation.</p><p>New York law allows a person over the age of 62 to break a lease without penalty if you receive notice that you've been accepted into a senior residential facility after signing the lease, or if you provide notice from a doctor that you can no longer live on your own and need to move in with a family member. <a href=""http://codes.findlaw.com/ny/real-property-law/rpp-sect-227-a.html"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">NY Real Prop.

You'd also have the option of finding a new tenant on your own in order to reduce your liability.

Thank you.</p></div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionCustomer"">Hi Lucy,<br/>So if I get the note from the doctor, then I can break the lease even if I'm not 62 years old? I just want to make sure, these things get complicated. I'll be moving to NJ to my dad's home and I can definitely get the doctors note. Will the landlord keep my deposit or can I still ask for it? Thank u.</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionExpert""><p>I'm sorry, I misread that. I was looking at where you were asking if someone over the age of 65 can break a lease. I'm afraid that statute won't apply if you're only 41. You would be responsible for rent until a new tenant is found - but you can advertise the place yourself to try to find someone faster.</p></div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionCustomer"">This is not good. So the landlord will rather see someone really sick, who could die and they just care about the money. Can i take this issue to court? I'm not talking about me being sick for a month or two. I'm disabled for life and could have a rejection to the organ transplant I received at any time. I know you don't create the laws, but landlords don't see this type of situation in a young person? Someone young had to run into an issue like this one before. Pretty unlucky, but there has to be something out there regarding this situation I'm in. Should i get evicted? I can't stay here and take care of myself. Thank u for your help.</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionExpert""><p>The landlord can't MAKE you stay. A person can always break a lease and move. But you were asking about breaking the lease <u>without a penalty</u>, which is not the same thing. You can move. They can't stop you. But they can sue for unpaid rent after you leave.</p><p>If you do not have substantial assets and your only income is disability, they will have no way to collect a judgment from you. They can report it on your credit, but they can't force you to give them money you don't have.</p></div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionCustomer"">U r right, I'm trying to do this without the penalties, the drama and getting a really negative entry on my credit report. I didn't think I will have to move quick. This is the third lease I signed with them. They always get their money. I paid all the late fees that got added to my acct when I spend weeks in a hospital in NYC. I wish it wasn't so difficult for someone like me.</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionExpert""><p>Me, too. I really am sorry. The thought behind the law is that, since the landlord didn't cause your illness, it's not fair for them to lose money because of it. It's different with senior citizens because the law puts them on notice that they might have to move last minute. I hope you can work something out.</p><p>Please rate my answer positively to ensure I get paid for the time I spend answering your questions. If you are on a mobile device, you may need to scroll to the right. Thank you.</p></div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionCustomer"">I'm worry about a negative entry on my report, but I will do it just because my health comes first. But, then the landlord will probably go after my husband because he does have a job. He is the one that provides me with the necessary health insurance and decent living. Has anyone else seen the type of case I have in any other state? I just feel it is so wrong. They can keep my month &amp; half deposit, but it seems I will still lose. Feels like I'm being punish for having bad luck and health. So stressful. Perhaps I don't like the answer, but I feel that it has to be a way. Someone had this issue before somewhere in the USA. Some kind of option</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionExpert""><p>I would dearly love to tell you what you want to hear, but it doesn't help you at all if I say ""Yes, you can move without penalty"" and then you get sued. My job is to tell you the truth, whether you like it or not. That's what customers agree to pay us for - a polite and honest answer.</p><p>Your problem is not unique. Many tenants have to move because of medical issues. And they remain liable on the rent until a new tenant is found. Or, they advertise the place themselves and find a new tenant to avoid losing money. I absolutely agree that it's not fair for you to lose money because of your bad luck and health. But, from a legal perspective, it would be even less fair for your landlord to lose money because of your bad health.

They won't sympathize with my health issues or if I just dropped dead. So I get it, they'll sue me or my husband because I don't have money to pay rent until the end of the lease next year.

When the seller is motivated, and the Realtor, needs the commission, the deal usually gets made.</p><p>I hope that I have provided excellent service and, if so, would love a 5 star rating.

This amendment codified what was already deemed a legal practice by the Department of State and the Attorney General’s office, which had each previously issued opinions, letters and/or decisions agreeing that a licensed broker could offer rebates to their clients as an incentive for using its services.  The operative section reads as follows (with the new amended language in underline):</p><p>“Except when permitted pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section, no real estate broker shall pay or agree to pay any part of a fee, commission or other compensation received by the broker, or due, or to become due to the broker to any person, firm or corporation who or which is or is to be a party to the transaction in which such fee, commission or other compensation shall be or become due to the broker; <u>provided, however, that nothing in this section shall prohibit a real estate broker from offering any part of a fee, commission, or other compensation received by the broker to the seller, buyer, landlord or tenant who is buying, selling, exchanging, leasing, renting or negotiating a loan upon any real estate including the resale of a condominium or cooperative apartment.

Such easements are known as affirmative easements.  Some easements limit how a property owner may use his property.  These are known as negative easements.</p><p>Forming Easements in NY</p><p>Easements are typically divided into two classifications based upon whether they benefit a particular person or a particular parcel of land.</p><ol><li><strong>Easements In Gross</strong> – Easements in gross benefit a particular individual or a particular entity. Easements in gross terminate upon the death of the grantee and may not be sold or assigned by him during his lifetime.</li><li><strong>Easement Appurtenant </strong> - Easements appurtenant benefit a particular parcel of land.  Easements appurtenant must be in writing, signed by the grantor, and identify the dominant and servient estates.  The dominant estate is the land which benefits from the easement.  The servient estate is the land which is burdened by the easement.  Under New York law, an easement appurtenant may be extinguished by abandonment, conveyance, condemnation, or adverse possession.</li></ol><ul></ul><p><strong>Express Easements</strong> – An express easement may be created by deed or other written instrument.  When called upon to interpret an express easement, New York courts seek to ascertain the intent of the parties by looking to the circumstances surrounding the execution of the easement agreement.</p><p><strong>Easements By Implication From Preexisting Use</strong> – To establish an easement by implication from preexisting use, a claimant must prove three elements:</p><ol><li>Unity of title followed by a subsequent separation of title;</li><li>That prior to the separation of title, the claimed easement had been used for so long and in such an obvious or apparent manner as to demonstrate it was meant to be permanent; and</li><li>That the use is necessary for the beneficial use and enjoyment of the property retained.</li></ol><p><strong>Easements By Necessity</strong> – To prove the existence of an easement by necessity, a claimant must show a severance of the unity of title that gave rise to the the necessity for the easement.  If the need for the easement was not present at the time of the severance of the unity of title, an easement by necessity will not be found.</p><p><strong>Easements By Prescription</strong> – An easement by prescription may be proven upon a showing that the use of the land over which the easement is claimed had been adverse, open, notorious, continuous, and uninterrupted for at least ten years.  <a href=""http://www.realestatelawyers.com/resources/real-estate/land-use-zoning/New-York-easement-law.htm"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.realestatelawyers.com/resources/real-estate/land-use-zoning/New-York-easement-law.htm</a></p></div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionCustomer"">Could you phrase your answer in a more laymans terminology</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionExpert""><p>I am getting there.

The court orders this and if your son continues to block the other son he would be held in contempt of court.  If your son is landlocked but there is no easement or right of way agreement recorded or in in writing the law establishes what is known as an easement by necessity.</p><p>""Easements by Necessity</p><p>Even if it isn’t written down, a legal easement can exist if it’s absolutely necessary to cross someone’s land for a legitimate purpose.

If a buyer is truly interested in doing this you should be able to get a real estate agent to help you to arrange a closing very quickly (it can be done in about a week) with an escrow set up and all payments to be made to the bank and condo association on that closing date (which will be BEFORE The foreclosure date -- you have up until the foreclosure date to facilitate a sale of the property).   So, if the first person who can pay off all the debt can get this arranged through a real estate agent before the foreclosure date, you should go with that offer.   Even if there is not enough time to arrange the closing BEFORE the foreclosure court date, if you appear in court with a signed purchase and sale agreement between yourself as seller and the buyer and show the judge that the buyer has placed a deposit in escrow to insure that he or she will proceed with the closing, you will probably be able to get the judge to issue a thirty day stay on the foreclosure to give you enough time to get to a legal closing date (using escrow and real estate agent and title company to accomplish). -Regarding the second offer -- you should not agree to it or trust it.  Myself and many other attorneys I know have seen this happen over and over again to people like yourself -- what happens is that you give this person a deed, but because the MORTGAGE is still in your name, you are still legally responsible for the mortgage and what could happen is that he can be sitting pretty in the condo (they ask for continuances on the foreclosure and delay it as long as they can and they either live in the condo or rent it our while they are doing a dance with the court).   All the while,  the mortgage company continues to pursue you for the payments as well because your name is ***** ***** the mortgage (while you can walk away from the property you cannot walk away from the debt).  In addition to playing games with the lender, this person will either NOT record the deed OR the condo association will refuse to recognize him as the owner because the mortgage is still in your name (which is their right to do) and so he may pay some of the condo fees but will then let them get run up again in your name.   Ultimately what happens is that he gets a year or so of a free condo to live in or rent out until the bank and the condo association realizes what happened here, and while they will take steps to legally have him removed they will also still pursue you for the original mortgage and any additional condo fee debt that has been run up between the time you gave him a deed and the time that the lender actually does take the property back.  -If you are unable to save your condo with a legitimate buyer who wants to go through a legal legitimate closing, and you are simply unable to afford to live there any longer, then you might consider seeking protection under the US Bankruptcy laws.  If it appears that the bank is foreclosing and both the bank and the condo association is still going to pursue you personally in a civil lawsuit for any money they lose if the sale does not cover the debt, then you can discharge these debts AND all unsecured credit card debt in a bankruptcy proceeding in just a few months time.  TO do this, you should consult a local bankruptcy attorney in your area -- if you contact your local county bar association and ask them for referrals to some local bankruptcy attorneys they will give you several names and you can speak to them and then go from there once you consult with the bankruptcy attorney. -Please let me know if you have further questions.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionCustomer"">i already have filed chapter 11 and got 6 months delay but stay eventually was lifted. I have another apartment attached next door with a different bank and mortgage which are only in first stages of the foreclosure action. if I now file chapter*****will take all secured assets including my second apartment and liquidate it. so I will be losing my second apartment sooner than later. So i dont want to file chapter 7 because it will be a danger of losing my safe nest i have for right now because i may have another year or so until foreclosure process goes through court system. so there is no such a thing that my debt will be going away because they sell my home and then my debt goes away. 1.As for my options of selling the apartment i already know it will be a straight forward one and  everyone will be paid but i wont make any money at all.  2.  The second option transfer of the deed, since as you say the building will be satisfied QUESTION is why would the building care if i do or do not transfer the deed to someone else as long as they get paid same amount of 125k that if i sell the apartment?  i think they will be upset if during battel they dont get their fees.  would they still be upset if they get paid back pay and monthly payments during battle between the deed guy and the bank?  Also the deed guy may let me stay in my home for a while as well, not so sure about it.  if i do stay i have to pay the condo fees for both apartments so building wont be upset but not sure if i can afford it.if i cant afford may be they let me rent out the second apartment to give their money but i doubt they will accept. So QUESTION: why would building worry if the bank is happy or unhappy? the bank has to go back to court and fight it out . so what this guy probably has in mind is to give a run around to bank or tell them to agree for payments less than what is owed. i take it since bank has to go through lots more of hearings and delays and losses they may just  agree to make peace with him. if they agree this is where i am worried about.right now i owe the bank $1,800,000.  they stubbornly wont agree to short sale and they think they will make their money in auction sale which most likely will go for 2,000,000 which building probably will get some amount. but do you know why the building likes me to sell rather than go on foreclosoure auction. i suppose there is a risk apt wont sell for total pay off amount and bank has to pull out of the auction and sell it in open market which means building will be left with unpaid dues much longer. QUESTION:  would you know why building prefers me to sell rather than go for forelcousre auction?  QUESTION:  the second most important issue for me is that if this guy gives run around to the bank and eventually makes peace with them and pays them $1.4M instead of $1.8 M then there would be outstanding mortgage of $400k which I will still be responsible for. Does that mean bank will come after me and put a summary judgment against my second apartment? if that happens would they be able to file a foreclosure action or it will only be a summary judgement? if only summary judgement they have to wait for the second bank to start foreclosure action. if second bank forecloses i know there wont be much money left.QUESTION: if there is little money left, may be $200k, who would take priority? Bank's judgement or building's judgement? right now with first apt building is after bank but it is the bank holding my mortgage. but lets say the second bank takes $1,300k and there is $200 left would building gets it or since first bank has the outstanding amount of mortgage they will get it? this is my main problem. i know deed guy will give a run around to the bank and i think bank will agree to make peace. you said bank will fight in the court come after me why is that important i will lose my home to foreclosure same thing as now. who cares i am losing it now what difference does it make. deed guy may even let me stay in the apartment for another year as long as i pay dues. QUESTION is if he makes a deal with the bank and pays them less would bank come after me for the remaining?. if they come after me for remaining would they be able to foreclsoure on my second apartment or it will be only a judgement.  if they are able to get a judgement and then my apartment goes on foreclosure sale will they be the first to get paid from the proceeds of auction of second home or building will take priority? the point is that as long as i am not messing up with the building and somehow satisfy them why would they care about bank. bank played it dirty with me with not agreeing to short sale. FINAL ISSUE:  My other apartment i am hoping the second bank wont have the note and never be able to foreclose on me that means i can file for quiet title. if i file building will foreclose on me and get some of equity would this be a wise move?  unless i can stay there not file quiet title but pay building to keep happy</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionCustomer"">QUESTION: How about i write in my contract with the deed guy they have to be responsible for total mortgage one way or another.  this way when they fight the bank they can make agreement bank wont come after me for the rest of the mortgage.  if they do i show them the contract.  any way summary is if i transfer the deed and bank doesnt get fully paid would they be able to foreclose on my second apartment or just a judgeemnt.  if just a judgement would builing condo fee take priority over their judgement. as long as building starts getting paid would they care if deed is transfered to someone else.  if the bank doesnt agree to short sale to deed guy and fights it and comes back after me by then i will owe them alot more than market price courts will force the bank to write off the difference these days so most likley they will make peace with this guy.  he is an expert taking all chances what is the risk to me? i dont even own a car.  all i have is two apartments both under water and in foreclosure. my only concern is mortgage be attached to second apartment i end up having quiet title building forces foreclosure to get their money and bank will get their summary judgement. but isnt that long way to go?  i am 64 years old do i care as long as i am safe another 3 years at least in one apartment and make little money from the deed guy to get my second run down apartment livable?  please advise based on all these positive points i have made.  not doubting your advise just giving more information from my situation and other assets to explore more.question is why building be unhappy as long as they get paid their monthly condo fees of both apartments and their 125k for now. why would bank move to fight this for another year lose money and get less because their cost will go up?  what are the disadvantage to me but a judgement.  if lose my second home judgement will be nothing to me no equity in the second apartment.  only time judgement will affect me is if i get quiet title on the second apartment.  what are the chances  i get quiet title i dont know.  the statue of 6 years from the acceleration is already past.  they have not attached the note to the summons.  i an fight them for a while.  i dont know if i can get quiet title but i am safe for a while LAST QUESTION: HOW ABOUT IF I ASK THE DEED GUY TO ASSUME THE MORTGAGE AM I SAFE  THANKS</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionCustomer"">i spoke to the deed guy he said he will include it in the agreement he will responsible for mortgage<br/>also just found out there is a 600k irs judgement agaisnt my ex husband.  i can clear it and get cirtificate of detachment but now i am not sure if i want to.  if it goes on foreclosure auction would it be wiped out?  i owe the bank 1.800k i owe building 500k market price is not more than 2.300k it will not sell in auction more than 2.000kbank takes the first priority then i suppose building then nothing left for irs.  what happens to it would it go away or they will go find another asset to attach it to?  how about people at auction would i be able to go show the judgement scare them?  would they ask the bank to sell it cheaper than 1.8 meaning 1.2?  or they would just ignore it and buy it regular bidding which most likley will go for minimum of 1,800k<br/>i need to decide if i should tell the bank i plan to scare buyers convince them to sell short sale?</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionExpert"">Hello again ---Wow ! The questions are fast and furious in your last two paragraphs and I am trying to sort through so I can pull out the questions and give you answers to your concerns.  I am gong to try to address your issues, one by one, below but if I miss anything, please let me know and I am happy to go back and address anything I might have missed while reading your responses above............................-1. Bankruptcy:  In addition to CH 7 liquidation there is also a CH 13 filing that can be made where you pay the mortgage payments going forward and any amounts that you currently owe to the lender are lumped in with other secured and unsecured debt which you pay over a 60 month period (5 years).  THe secured creditors (such as your mortgage lender and the condo association liens) must be paid in FULL during this time period but any unsecured creditors receive pennies on a dollar.  The amount of the monthly payment is set by the bankruptcy court and at the end of the payment period you still own your condo and can continue to pay the mortgage.   I generally suggest CH 7 to people who simply want to walk away from the property without being pursued by the mortgage lender for a deficiency amount and a CH 13 filing to people who are interested in keeping the property for at least 60 months into the future and they can afford to make the monthly mortgage payment and the monthly payment to the court to be applied to the past due amount over the upcoming 60 months.  In a CH 13 bankruptcy you can also choose to stop paying the monthly payment amount after which the trustee will dismiss the CH 13 action and you can then convert it to a CH 7 liquidation amount.  If you are simply interested in living in one of the properties for another 3 years or so, then a CH 13 filing might be an option for you but in order to make it work you MUST file the Ch 13 bankruptcy petition BEFORE The foreclosure hearing takes place (most bankruptcy attorneys can file with the federal court system in a matter of a few hours and so you truly can file a bankruptcy petition on the day before the court foreclosure hearing and that may halt the actions going forward.  However, you said you had already filed a CH 11 petition so this CH 13 filing may not work for you either (Chapter 11 bankruptcy petitions are generally used by businesses to reorganize their debt and it is similar to a Ch 13 filing (while a CH 11 petition CAN be used for an individual and individual debt, usually the CH 13 petition is used because it is a personal finances &amp;quot;reorganization&amp;quot;).   It cannot hurt to discuss all of this with your bankruptcy attorney (if you have one at this time) or to simply contact a few local bankruptcy attorneys locally to briefly discuss this option with them to see if there is ANY benefit at all to you in proceeding with any further actions with the bankruptcy court at this time.  -2. The second property and the mortgage loan on it.    If the second property that is NOT in foreclosure at this time has a mortgage loan from the SAME bank as your first condo property then there may be either/or both &amp;quot;cross-collateralization&amp;quot; language or &amp;quot;Cross-default&amp;quot; language in either one or both of the mortgages.  In fact, it is quite common for a lender to use this language in the mortgages of customers who have more than one mortgage and property with the lender. The language typically gives the lender the right to accelerate ALL loans then outstanding with them in the event of a default on just ONE of the loans.   So even if you are paid up to date on the other condo loan with this same lender, they can still choose to accelerate that loan as well and then they can sell both at a foreclosure auction (using judicial foreclosure they would have to get permission from the judge to proceed with such actions).  I realize that mortgages and other loan documents can be boring as heck to read (I used to read and write them for a living and it is no wonder that I still have a few migraine headaches a month although I am working in other areas and fields for most of my time now) -- but you should review your mortgages for these condos and determine if there is any regular or fine print which actually states that any additional secured loan that you receive from the lender using property other than the subject property as collateral is also secured by any additional properties or assets that you may receive loans on at a later date.  And, in the event that you default on this loan from the lender, the lender has the right to declare a default on all loans outstanding with them and reserves the right to foreclose on any such additional collateral whether the loan secured by that other collateral is in default in its own right or not.  THere is also usually a &amp;quot;standard&amp;quot; clause that goes along with this provision permitting the lender to take ANY payments that you make to the other condo loan and credit the payment or payments towards the  outstanding default amount on the first condo loan.  There is no &amp;quot;EXACT&amp;quot; legal language that is used or must be used to accomplish/create a cross collateralization and/or cross default obligation in each loan situation but unless you are aware of the provision being in the documents then you generally would not have asked for the lender to remove it as part of the negotiations leading up to your property purchase(s) and signing the loan documents to make those purchases.  I used to write these documents when working for large law firms who represented the lenders in these transactions and the language for cross C &amp;amp; D (as we used to call it) is actually a standard clause in their documents and unless you are aware that this is standard language or you read and review the documents with a fine tooth comb before the closing date and loan funding and find the language and question the language and the provision with the loan officer and/or lawyers before the loan documents are signed and the funding achieved then the borrower is generally stuck with these provisions in the loan documents (the language can be in the mortgage, the loan agreement (if there was a separate loan agreement), the promissory note or really any other operative loan document -- but it is generally found in the mortgage)).  SO, I suggest that you review your mortgage carefully before the foreclosure hearing and be prepared for the lender to seek permission from the court to use these clauses against you and your payments on the second condo loan -- your argument against the court granting such permission is basically that without the second condo loan and the second condo you will end up as a 64 year old homeless man with no assets to speak of and nothing more than the second condo to live in and if you can get the judge to agree to that then the lender will not be able to touch the second condo loan, the second condo property and the payments that you make towards the second condo loan. -3. Deficiency judgments in General and in New York, (A) Single Action rule:  There are many states, such as California, where the lender must choose whether they will pursue a single action against the property or against the Borrower for payment of the outstanding mortgage loan.  Once the choice is made, the lender cannot go back to court and change the choice made and must proceed with either an action to foreclose on the property OR a personal civil lawsuit against the Borrower to recover the loan principal.  While 99.99% of lenders simply choose to pursue the property in a foreclosure action (and can do so without going to court in a foreclosure proceeding) -- they simply choose non judicial foreclosure and proceed to use publication for foreclosure notification purposes and then sell the property at a foreclosure auction and taking these steps forever barrs the lender from pursuing the personal lawsuit action against the Borrower. So, the option for a deficiency judgment is not available in such states. (B) States where Deficiency Judgments are Generally Available  -- In states where a deficiency judgment IS available as a matter of regular course of law and business (such as Massachusetts), the lender is legally permitted to pursue a non judicial foreclosure action against the property first using the publication and &amp;quot;public&amp;quot; auction procedure, and then in the event that the auction price does not cover all of the outstanding loan amounts and any other debts that are liened against the property (such as contractors liens, IRS liens, child support liens or student loan liens) the lender can proceed to sue the borrower personally for personal assets and other real estate assets for up to 2 years after the foreclosure date (the statute of limitations varies by state as well (in those states that permit deficiency proceedings and judgments to go forward)).   You are correct, however, in your assumption that many lenders do not bother suing for a deficiency judgment because the borrower has no assets (the lender will generally make these decisions on a case by case basis after reviewing the financial status and age and earning capacity of the Borrower) and while judges can try to discourage a lender from pursuing deficiency judgments (in general or in a particular case), the judge does not have the right to simply dismiss a case because the judge does not believe in permitting deficiency judgments -- the judges must follow the law and make rulings in accordance with the law and if the lender is insistent, the deficiency judgment will be permitted and then ugly things like wage garnishment and bank account garnishment CAN happen (and this is where I generally suggest to people that if the lender starts to pursue a deficiency judgment against you and you actually have built up some assets a few years after the foreclosure or you finally landed a decent job a year or so later -- then you should probably consider a CH 7 liquidation bankruptcy -- because although you may lose some assets, the CH 7 bankruptcy halts wage garnishments forever and there are other advantages to filing a ch 7 at that point as well).(C) New York Procedure:   The great state of New York handles foreclosures and deficiency judgements in their own quirky way.  NY used to allow both judicial and non judicial foreclosures with most foreclosures occurring through court action.  Then, in 2009, NY changed their laws to permit ONLY judicial foreclosures due to the ongoing mortgage crisis and all of the controversies concerning the &amp;quot;robo signing&amp;quot; lawsuits against lenders.  Here is a link to a great explanation of the NY foreclosure process and the difference between non judicial and judicial foreclosure in NY -- http://nybankruptcy.net/main/2014/what-is-judicial-and-non-judicial-foreclosure-in-new-york/(there are also some great articles on bankruptcy and a few other topics from a small firm in Brooklyn NY (I worked with one of the partners of that firm when I was in NYC for a few years back in the early 00&amp;#39;s)).To finish this particular topic -- New York Deficiency Judgments -- Not only are such judgments available BUT in New York the lender can foreclose on the property AND sue the borrower personally for prospective or projected losses AT THE SAME TIME.   The lender must notify the judge at the judicial foreclosure proceeding that they have already or they will be filing a civil lawsuit against the Borrower and any personal assets that the Borrower might still have and then the Lender will be permitted to proceed with BOTH actions at the same time.  In most states it is either one or the other  (lender chooses whether to foreclose on the property but that is the only remedy the lender can take OR lender can choose to sue the Borrower civilly for the full amount of the principal of the loan. In the few states where both actions are still available, the lender must foreclose first to determine the amount still owed to the lender after the foreclosure sale and only THEN can the lender sue the Borrower civilly for any remaining balance still owed on the loan))(D) New York Law and Your Case -- under the circumstances described in (C) above, the lender can choose to proceed against your properties AND the lender can notify the court that it is also pursuing you personally in a civil action proceeding for any deficiency amount and anything else that the lender claims that you owe or that you will owe when the property or properties is/are sold  (whether or not the lender will seek the court&amp;#39;s permission to sell condo one at foreclosure AND condo two at foreclosure or short sale, etc. depends upon any language in the mortgages (or note or loan agreements, etc) regarding the lender&amp;#39;s rights to have the loans cross collateralized and/or cross-defaulted.    If the lender applies to pursue BOTH properties at the hearing and you are current on the condo two loan then you still have a decent chance of getting the judge to use his or her discretion and prohibit the lender from doing anything against you or the condo two property or loan as part of the lender&amp;#39;s overall pursuit to be made whole again from foreclosing on BOTH of your condos and also pursuing you in a civil action for any current/future  losses or deficiency amounts on the condo ONE loan.-4. Assignment of Mortgage to the &amp;quot;Deed&amp;quot; Man,   If you can get the man who asked to buy the Deed to also assume the mortgage and the condo lien and future payments to the condo association for monthly dues you can certainly prepare or have prepared a simple Assignment and Assumption Agreement to accomplish both your Assignment of these documents and debts to the Deed Man and the Deed Man&amp;#39;s agreement to Assume the documents and the debts associated with the documents - such legal document if notarized AND recorded in the property records after the Deed to him is recorded in the property records at the county level will certainly put the public on notice that you no longer own the property and you are no longer responsible for the mortgage or any condo liens or future fees to do with this property.  However, and this is a really LARGE HOWEVER -- Any such Assignment and Assumption Agreement between the two of you is not effective against the lender or the condo association unless you can get the permission of both parties before the Assignment and Assumption Agreement is executed by the two of you and to show that permission you either have to get the lender and/or the condo association to sign the Assignment and Assumption Agreement document itself (on the signature page a simple &amp;quot;accepted and agreed by UPTOWN BANK by XXXXXXXXXXXXX, authorized representative&amp;quot; - AND the signature also must be notarized and witnessed for acceptance by the county recorder&amp;#39;s office to record in the public records (the same type of signature block would be used for the condo association representative if they were also agreeable to this transfer of ownership and payment responsibilities to the DEED MAN).   If you go back to the mortgage (or loan agreement (if there is a loan agreement) or the note) and review the fine print again you will see another standard clause that the mortgage cannot be assigned by you to anyone else and cannot be assumed by any third party UNLESS the lender has approved of such assignment / transfer before the assignment and transfer takes place.   If you do not get their permission to assign the loan to DEED MAN or any other third party, then the lender can still legally pursue the property AND you personally in a civil action (and as we see from NY law, the lender can do BOTH at the same time).  I truly wish I could tell you that you can simply pull out the Assignment and Assumption document and force the lender AND the condo association to comply with the terms of the document, but you are powerless to stop the lender from pursuing you in a civil action against your personal assets if you did not get their permission to Assign the mortgage to a third party before it happened.   -5.  The Condo Association&amp;#39;s Powers.   Like the all knowing Oracle in Ancient Greece (or was it Rome, or both??) most condo associations must be kept aware of ownership and transfer of ownership situations and such powers are usually written into the charter documents of the condo association.  Review the formation documents for the condo association AND also review any written by-laws or rules and regulations for the owners of the condos.  There can also be a Covenant document that sets forth all of the covenants that each condo owner must abide by in order to remain on the good side of the ORACLE and not subject themselves to any additional reprimands, fines or ultimately LIENS from the condo association (any such covenant document is probably recorded at the county level with the other charter documents).   Legally speaking, the Condo Association cannot restrict who purchases the condo if they can afford the financing and the condo monthly fees going forward -- but many condo associations put restrictions on leasing (which is legally permissible for the condo association but completely annoying for those condo owners who wish to buy a house and cannot sell their condo so they want to rent it out and the condo association either limits the number of leases in the condo or completely forbids leasing out the units to third parties),  so they might be able to object o the assignment to DEED MAN based upon his financial records and/or credit checks but if DEED MAN is willing to sign an agreement stating that he will also be responsible for the condo association fees currently outstanding at the time the DEED is signed and transferred to him, then I cannot see where they could object or would want to object because they are getting paid, afterall.  I seriously doubt that the COndo Association will approve of the transfer of the deed unless the outstanding condo fees are paid at the time of the Deed execution.  -I know that this is a lot to digest but please let me know if I touched upon all of your questions and concerns from the first three response boxes that you typed up and posted above.  Please let me know if I can clarify anything in the treatise I prepped and just sent to you in the paragraphs above.  At the same time, I will review your last response typed and posted at 3:45 pm today (just a few minutes ago) and I will provide additional answers accordingly to that question or those comments.   -I also ask that you press a positive rating in the ratings section above.  I am paid NOTHING unless you press a positive rating before you leave the website ( pressing the middle star or the fourth or fifth star on the right of the middle star are all positive ratings ).   Pressing a positive rating above will NOT cost you any additional money -- it simply acts as the trigger mechanism to Just Answer to pay me for my time assisting you and answering your questions today.  While I pride myself on the fact that my answers to customers questions are generally more thorough and clearer than many of my colleagues postings in this forum  -- even I agree that my answers were quite lengthy above but you did ask a number of legitimate questions that were all interconnected and I truly had to pull it apart to address each issue one by one by one, etc.  so I am very sorry for the delay this has taken but I had to research some of the answers and then be clear in the explanations to you above.  I am very happy to finish up the conversation with you and continue to respond to your last posting in the response box above even if you press a positive rating above.  Your question actually stays open for a few weeks once we complete today&amp;#39;s sessions and you can post additional comments and seek responses within reason (the website does encourage customers to ask a new, separate question every several questions due to the fact that experts are not paid hourly wages -- we are paid for each question separately and only if you press a positive rating above.  Once a positive rating is pressed, the expert is credited with a portion of the amount that you paid overall for the question session and then a bonus popup box will appear on your screen and while bonuses are not required, any bonus is greatly appreciated AND are actually entirely paid to the expert without deduction by Just Answer.    -So again, please review the lengthy responses above and I will review your last post regarding the new agreements made by Deed Man and your self, etc and I will comment and answer that accordingly based upon what I have told you above about the status of your condo association loan and transaction(s) under NY law.   THANK YOU VERY MUCH !!-MARY (Legalease)-</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionExpert"">Hello again ---Regarding your first comment in the last question regarding the Deed Man&amp;#39;s willingness to assume responsibility for the mortgage --- again, as I said yesterday (above) -- this is all well and good but that agreement is effective only between yourself and the Deed Man and is not effective against the lender.  UNLESS you can get the lender to also sign the document and agree in writing to accept the DEED MAN as the operative / owner of the property in your place.   If the lender cannot get their payments or principal balance from the Deed Man then the lender still has the legal permissions to pursue you for any remaining balance that they cannot get from Deed Man.-Finally, the IRS gets paid only after all mortgages and all second mortgages are paid off from the proceeds of the sale OR from the proceeds of a short sale or foreclosure.   If there are not enough proceeds, then the IRS simply removes their liens and will pursue to person who owes the money on a personal basis and go after personal bank accounts and wages and investments, etc. At that point it might be wise to try to   negotiate an Offer in Compromise with the IRS.    The effect of such sale or judgement on the property in any foreclosure or short sale is nil (nothing) -- the IRS lien does not stay on the property for the new owners.-Please let me know if you have further questions. If not, can you please press a positive rating above so I will be paid for my time assisting you today? I am paid nothing unless you press a positive rating above (pressing the middle star or the fourth or fifth star on the right of the middle star). Doing so will not cost you any additional money -- it simply acts as the trigger to Just Answer to pay me for my time. After pressing a positive rating, a bonus pop up box will appear and although not required, any bonus is paid directly to the expert without deductions AND is greatly appreciated !! THANK YOU VERY MUCH</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionExpert"">Hello there --Do you have any further questions for me regarding these issues above ?  I actually put a great deal of work into researching and thoughtfully preparing your answers to your questions above because I am empathetic to anyone who is trying to save something out of a foreclosure process brought against them and I truly do not want to see you making any wrong moves with the lender because they will exploit anything they can to make the process easier and more streamlined for them.  I am surprised that you have not had any additional follow up questions on these matters because you were coming at me fast and furiously with follow up questions the other day and I kept up with you and answered all of them DESPITE not having been paid for my time to do so at that point.  -I am happy to answer any additional questions that you might have on these issues for as long as you need answers to the questions (or follow up questions or clarifications) -- but I ask that you press either the middle star or the fourth or fifth star to the right of the middle star so that I will be paid for my time for assisting you up to this point and over the past two days.  If you are having problems with your system or the ratings section please let me know and I can send the question to customer service to assist you with the ratings section if need be (it seems that you have given some positive ratings to some of the questions that you have asked but it appears that you may have had some trouble with the ratings section on other questions and so the expert is never paid anything for assisting you with those questions either).  It is truly up to the expert (lawyer, doctor, veterinarian, etc) regarding whether or not to answer a particular question and although I knew that the answer I needed to give to you would be lengthy and there would be follow up questions, I took the question from the open board because I am sympathetic to your foreclosure situation at your age during a time in your life when you should be enjoying yourself rather than fighting a foreclosure action on TWO properties.  -THANK YOU VERY MUCH !!!-MARY LEGALEASE</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionCustomer"">you are great but please you miss the fact that i said i filed chapter 11 (which is chapter 13 for homes above 1.3 m)  the stay was lifted i dont have money for reorganization which is over 20k per month.<br/>your answer was very good but i need to clarify another thing.  25e is in foreclosure with wells fargo.  25f in foreclsoure with bank of america.  building got foreclsoure judgement of 250k against both of them and was sent to referee for calculations.  but since their payment is subject to mortgage they did not pursue foreclsoure because bank got there already.ok with all these i have this choice of selliing my apartment not making any money.  or sell the deed.<br/>the idea of getting permision from the bank is good but they would never agree to it unless they are fully paid.  this guy says he is going to buy the deed then go satisfy the bank.  what does that mean i dont know?  he acts as if once deed is to his name he will have this magical power to convince the bank to sell the mortgage cheapter.  Why  i dont know.  one lawyer told me even deed is to his name auction can just move forward.  when i told deed man that he said he plans to pay the bank fully before auction.  i said if you are paying the bank fully and paying the building the 125k then why are you bothering with purchase of deed why not just go ahead and buy the apartment.  he said you dont understand and wont give me straight answer.  ok in the past i did transfer a deed from my husabnd and my name to only my name.  the bank didnt know.  i then refinanced and paid the bank.  in this case if i dont ask for their permision as long as they are paid why woudl they come suing me?  the idea is if i transfer the deed and they dont get paid right?  now if they are not getting paid what they want meaning the entire(###) ###-####then they have to sue me and sue him etc while incurring cost and late fees and interest and legal fees.  so what is the chance the bank will take what this guy has to offer them and call it a done deal.<br/>so these are all issues here.  but the fact remains:  a what kind of contract  i have to sign with the deed man you said some terms i have to go back to look at your notes.  what is it exactly i have to sign with him?  is it transfer of deed form is it regular sales contract?  my lawyer sent a regular sales contract for 150,000!! how could a sales contract be for $150k and not mention anyting about mortgage and condo fees owed to him. i am just not in line with this lawyer and have to search for a new one.  so this is is one<br/>QUESTIONS<br/>:1.  what kind of forms i am supposed to sign?  sales and contract, sales and tansfer of deed etc2.  the next thing is the building.  even if he pays the building what they have said they agree on he also have to gaurnatee he will pay their monthly payments.  if he is battling with the bank over deed and they are suing me etc., meanwhile someone has to pay for the condo fees. Question is:is transfer of deed also makes him responsible for condo fee payments?<br/>3.  if i transfer the deed does that stop the foreclosure auction or it will still move forward unless he pays them.<br/>4.  if he has to pay them why doesnt he just buy the apartment instead of paying them? why doesnt he go buy the mortgage,  there has to be something he is upto after i transfer the deed to him that is going to make it lucritive to him otherwise why to bother all this?  ok i transfer the deed he will pay the building and pay me then what is the upper hand he has agasint the bank? there has to be one for him to have this deal attractive to him<br/>5.  if i transfer the deed to him he can just not pay the bank then go on foreclsoure auction day and buy it there.  this way he is stopping me from the dale of the apartment to anyone else and buying it in foreclosure auction.  is it possible that is what is in his mind?<br/>6.  if i transfer the deed to him you say the bank will come after me.  why?  if transfer of deed and he doesnt pay then bank forecloses and makes their money any way.  why to come after me?  i know if they sell they will make their money.  if they dont i am sure they wont come after me.  i think the issue here is if this guy doesnt pay any of it.  it is not if the bank made enough money in auction.  if they make or dont make money in auction i am not worried about it.  i had asked for short sale they didnt agree to it.  that was their choice to go on auction.  plus they said if they dont they will pull it out and go put it in open market.  this is a very desirable and sought after apartment and eventually they will make their money.  so my issue is if you say they will come after me when do they do that?  if he owns the deed bank can still foreclose so that means they cant come after me.  b.  if he owns the deed and bank doesnt get paid they they can sue me .  in that case i have the agreement with deed man i can pull it out and say not my problem he said he is going to pay the deed.  if the courts make him to pay</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionCustomer"">then why would the bank be upset i transfered the deed.  I did the same in my ex husband's case I transfered the deed to my name no one noticed it or complained then i paid the bank.  so the issue here is not what bank may sue me all the attention of me is why this guy wants to pay me and have the deed to his name.  what is his benefit?  The only thing he keeps saying is that he has his contacts with bank meaning he can convince them to sell it to him cheaper.  i am sure there is no convinciing there has to be some legal battle that he feels bank wont pursue and will make peace for getting paid less money.<br/>So the portion i am concerend is:  QUESTION:  .  if bank agrees to take less from him does that mean they will come after me for rest or once they do agree to less money from him i am cleared<br/>all this comes up to this:""<br/>I WANT TO MAKE THE MONEY BUT DONT WANT TO SIGN A CONTRACT THAT IS NOT PROTECTING ME,.  what kind of contract i should sign one two transfer of deed sales contract of gaurantee or the one  you wrote.<br/>also i know he has to plans to ask the bank i cant ask the bank 5 days before the auction do you mind signing this of course they are not going to agree to it unless there is a clearance they will fully be paid upon signing it.  as for the building i dont think they will sign but i plan to tell them verbally before hand and as long as they get paid and there is a new owner who is wealthy they will be ok.  i mentioned it a while ago to the building lawyer she said it is illegal but not too firmely  builing was upset about transfer of deed of my ex but nothing they could really do they just came after me for their condo fees  QUESTION:  Is the deed owner or the mortgage holder who is to pay the condo fees?  I think you told me mortgage holder but i dont know that is what you said<br/>QUESTION:  considering my apartment 25f is a different bank if there is a judgement from wells fargo woudl that mean they can foreclsoure on 25f or it  is simplay a judgement.  25f is under water i owe B of A more than market price.  so if it goes on sale of auction wells fargo wont make money so most likely wont bother putting judgement.  but if they do my problem is that may be only may be with some luck in life  i will be able to have a quiet title of 25F.  if there are too many judgements i will be left with no equity of the apartment.  also if there is any chance wells fargo can foreclsoure on my second aparment i dont want to take the risk.  i think i know the anser wells fargo cant foreclsoure on my assets because it is only a judgement but if they can get a permision to foreclose on it in future that is my concern<br/>ok so this is the issue if bank doesnt fully get paid lets say by this guy, they put a judgement agaisnt my other apartment woudl they be able to foreclose or it will only be a judgement?<br/>i think if you just give me a short answers we will be clear.  the question i had about quiet title i dont want you to go trhough trouble with that.  i have time to figure it out but at the same time it is related because if the other bank forecloses on me and take all the money i dont care who has judgment or foreclsoure rights on my assets.<br/>i dont work i am a full time attorney to my children;s life and my job has been to save their home until they grow up and leave home!!!  that is what has now happened.  i am losing my home i rasied them in it because i kept refinanicng to save it for them.  i am not worried about judgements against my pay check.  i have little alimoney coming to me and judgements cant touch alimonys.<br/>thant you you haev been great will give you positive and more and may want to call but if i call would it be you or someone elseas for your pay yes you are great.  but i realy dont need all that information that you haev gone through so much trouble to provide to me.</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionCustomer"">also you wrote:   I truly wish I could tell you that you can simply pull out the Assignment and Assumption document and force the lender AND the condo association to comply with the terms of the document, but you are powerless to stop the lender from pursuing you in a civil action against your personal assets if you did not get their permission to Assign the mortgage to a third party before it happened.QUESTION:  when you say personal assets are you talking about 25e which i gave to deed man?  or you are talking about my other assets?  if they are coming after 25e why is that important i am losing it to foreclsure already so what is big deal they come after that i have made my money of*****so why to worry if they take it ?  can they take it from deed man and sell it in auction?  i was told yes they can still pursue the auction.  if they pursue the auction i hae my money in my pocket what difference does it make for me?  if they dont pursue on the auction and they get  a judgement agaisnt my other asset that is the problem.  meaning deed man is untouchable my 25e is no longer mine to put judgment agasint it and they will go after 25f/  that is the issue.  please remember i am losing 25e in 7 days.  the issue is shold i let it go on auction or transfer the deed to this guy who gives me 150 k and gives bulding 125k?   or should i sell it get no money?<br/>as i said you say they will come after my assets?  is 25e still considered my asset even he has the deed?  if no then i think that will be a problem.  but at the same time someone told me they will be able to foreclsoure even if the deed is transfered to this guy.  he said think about it if anyone who has an auction last minute can put deed under someone els's name and then the auction would stop,  i dont agree with this lawyer because most people wont take an aparment with such a huge loan before auction because it would only be on their records unless they plan to pay the mortgage and this is what the deed man says he will do.  so that means transfer of deed must be stopping the bank and he an go negotiate and say hay what do you want to do it you cant foreclsoure on me<br/>so plesae question:  if deed is no longer on my name can bank move forward with auction?  if not then they have to sue both of us for illegal transfer or they will only sue me. if they sue me woudl the court grants them the right to foreclsoure on 25e?  or will grant them judgement agasint my other apartment?  clearly will say it was illegal and give them back 25e am i right-</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionExpert"">Hello again ---You asked many questions and I tried to answer them as I went along but was not even sure I was remembering every question that you asked.    The lender can foreclose on the property even if the deed is transferred to someone else -- if the mortgage remains in your name, that property is still the collateral for the original loan.  Think about it -- legally it does not matter whose name is ***** ***** deed -- if it is a clear promissory note, mortgage and loan agreement (if there was a loan agreement -- in many cases, the lenders will simply put the terms of the loan agreement into the mortgage and have only one document) then the secured collateral for the mortgage is STILL the property (that has not changed).   This answer has not changed and will not change no matter how many times you restate the same question in a little bit different manner.   Whatever lawyer originally told you this was correct and you seem to be seeking a different opinion on the matter -- you want an answer that conforms with what you want to do with the property and neither I nor any of my colleagues can give you a different answer to this question. MARY</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionCustomer"">you wrote:  "" If the lender cannot get their payments or principal balance from the Deed Man then the lender still has the legal permissions to pursue you for any remaining balance that they cannot get from Deed Man.""  as i mentioned a lawyer told me that even if the deed is to his name bank still can foreclose on the house.  so what is there to come after me besides the same thing happens if i dont sign with the deed man.  or bank cant foreclose on his any more and will come after my other assets.  which one?  foreclose on E apartment whihc they already haev an order or come after my F apartment adn file a foreclsoure action or just put a judgement agaisnt it?i had just typed this email above but then went and reach what you had said in this last email.  remember you had said they will come after me but you had not mentioned what does that mean as i have asked many time which apartment.  ok again the question is if i transfer the deed to his name and he doesnt pay the bank they will come after me why do i care?  may 17th is auction date.  i assigned the deed i get 150 and then deed man either pays the bank or doesnt pay the bank. if he pays them good for him he can have the apartment.  if he doesnt pay the bank they foreclose on him, why do i care i have my 150.  you seem to be missing the fact that thsi home is in foreclsoure i am not giving a big equity aparment away.  i am giving an apartment that is under the water so he is taking the loan and all the high debts and giving me money;  what is my problem if bank gets upset they foreclsoure on my apartment.  isnt this what they are doing right now?<br/>my only problem is that he satisfies my condo board.  that is why i haev said you pay me 150 and then 125 to condo board and then what he wants to do with the bank not my problem.  if he doesnt pay bank forecloses basically on his and he loses $275 if bank doesnt foreclose on him then he can pay the bank all he owes them or partial and satisfy them and i sit in the corner with my 150!!!<br/>this is the problem.  what is the harm to me you keep saying they can come after me.  that confuses me because i haev another asset.  now you say they will foreclsoure on the same apartment and i say they are doing that any way<br/>so i need to know what is the harm of signing with this man besides them foreclsoin on the apartment?  you had said absolutely not do it in your first email ,  since then i have given you more information so  i can get more clear decision.  i still dont know if you have changed your mind that it is ok for me to do it or you think still i should not.  again if i have violated the bank's agreement and transfered the deed who cares bank is going to foreclsoure and get their money any way whose problem is if i did something  i was not supposed to do/.  i just dont understand the implications of all these to end result no matter how i break the contreact and i do this and that what is the end results for me and why i am in any negative position than if i just let it go on foreclsure ?  why to let it go on foreclsoure but not make money out of it?thanks</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionCustomer"">you did not answer me if i call i get you or someone else.  plus how long i can speak on the phone?</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionExpert"">Hello again---Perhaps things are getting lost in the translation here.  Your lender can do any of the following as it so chooses to do AND because NY is NOT a single action rule state (as I explained earlier ) the lender can do ALL of these things AT THE SAME TIME -- (A) sue you and Deed Man to foreclose on the property (if the lender did not approve of the transfer/ assignment of the deed to Deed Man), AND (B) Sue you and Deed Man for any deficiency in the price of the sale and the price they get for the property AND for any condo fees still outstanding at foreclosure (sometimes the lender will pay off the condo fees at foreclosure so It can deliver clear title to the buyer at foreclosure and can then sue the Borrower and your Deed Man, AND (C) If both of your mortgages have cross collateral and/or cross default provisions with any other properties and loans that you have with the same lender, then the lender can move to foreclose on your other property at the same time as the other foreclosure if they are fairly confident that they are going to end up having a deficiency in the first condo foreclosure between the outstanding mortgage and the price they sell the property for ( I did explain this earlier also).  If there is already a judgment lien on the other condo then they can ask the court to let them foreclose on that property as well as the other property that is already in default.=If you request a call and you want to talk to another attorney, that is fine (I will not accept the request and leave it on the board for another attorney to review and call you if they wish to do so).  Telephone calls do cost an additional fee and it must be paid for and accepted before the call is made to you.

"[<div class=""qnaBoxTitle""><h1> <!-- -->I work for a property management company and we are trying to correctly calculate what to charge the tenant as a late</h1></div>, <div class=""qnaBoxFirstChat""><strong> Customer: </strong> I work for a property management company and we are trying to correctly calculate what to charge the tenant as a late fee. New York law does not allow for annual interest rates over 16%. However, the late charge we bill is based on a one time interest charge on the balance that is still owed. The language in the lease states:""for corporate or governmental entity lessees the late charge shall be computed<br/>at two percent per month unless there is an appl icable maximum legal rate of interest which<br/>then shall be used""Since the maximum legal rate of interest is 16%, can I charge that one time on the balance that is owed? Or, do I need to divide it by 12 months for an interest rate charge of 1.33%?Also, if the tenant 'short pays' by a different amount the next month, do I need to subtract the previous month's late charge from the new balance that remains outstanding?Just want to know if we are reading the lease correctly regardless of whether it will hold up in court.</div>]","[<div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionExpert""><p>Good evening. NY does not have a specific law regarding late fees, but we follow the usury law for maximum amount allowed. Since you can't go over the 16$ per year the interest rate would have be divided by the 12 months.  You don't have to subtract the previous months late charge from the new balance, just calculate the amount on the whole amount due an owing.  I hope this helps with your question.</p></div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionCustomer"">ThanksBut if I divide by 12 for the interest rate then I am assuming that I am going to carry it for next month - which I am not.  It's a one time charge and the tenant my become current next month.Also, am I allowed to dump the prior months late fee into the bucket of @additional rent"" owed next month?   Just thought NY law didn't allow for late fees on top of late fees.Is there a link to the state rules or case law for this as well?</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionExpert""><p>Ok.  maybe I can re explain. The rule that courts in New York have followed is a better guideline. The amount of a late charge  must be reasonable and non-punitive and must bear some reasonable relationship to the amount of rent involved.   Most landlord's simply the amount and have a 1.3% late fee on amount owed.  So if the tenant's rent is $1,000 month then you can charge 13.00 month as a later fee.  if they do not pay then they $1,013.00, and if they do not pay the next month you still charge $the $1,013.00 owed with late fees.  if they only pay part of the rent $500.00 then you pro- rate what was paid and calculate the interest on the outstanding $500.00 + $6.50 amount and bring the total forward to the next month and add both together for the total amount owed.</p></div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionCustomer"">Thanks,I understand better.  But, technically (and literally) does the excerpt that I quoted indicate that I can charge the maximum (16%) on the amount owed, even if it won't hold up in court?</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionExpert""><p>The clause, ""for corporate or governmental entity lessees the late charge shall be computed<br/>at two percent per month unless there is an applicable maximum legal rate of interest which<br/>then shall be used"", can be legally interpreted to mean  that because the legal rate is 16% you can only charge the legally allowed maximum rate of 16%.  Keep in mind that the criminal usury rate is 25%.   You could continue to charge the 2% a month, and then if it is brought up in court, the judge will not allow the 2 % rate because it is  not reasonable and punitive.</p></div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionCustomer"">technically I am correct in my interpretation that I can charge 16% one time on an overdue balance?      And the next month I can charge 16% on a different overdue balance that may include the previous months late fees?</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionExpert"">legally you can charge 16% on the unpaid amount, which is an unpaid balance and then compounded into the new amount past due.</div>]"

The word I got from my broker is that the board member and the buyer had a fighting match?</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionExpert""><p>If there was a disagreement between the potential buyer and the Board it would be difficult to force a sale under New York law. The courts in New York give coop boards great leeway in approving a sale.  The board is made up of shareholders and the courts rely of their judgment regarding an approval of a sale.  The 7 months is also not grounds for an action against the board, the only cause if action against the board is discrimination against either the seller or buyer, and the burden of proof is high.</p></div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionCustomer"">Not even a deposit refund?   Sounds like it is a merely a personal vendetta to me?  why should I suffer?  I was a broker for 38 years and this doesn't make sense</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionExpert""><p>What deposit did you put down? You would not be able to legally retain the buyers deposit on contract because coop contracts usually contain a clause that if the ""Board does not approve the sale , then all monies on deposit will be refunded"".  However, if your contract has a clause that the deposit can be retained if the sale does not go through due to the buyers negligence or other actions, then you may have a right to keep the deposit from the buyer.</p></div>]"

Thank you !</div>]","[<div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionExpert"">Thank you for your question.  I look forward to working with you to provide you the information you are seeking for educational purposes only.<br/>If a tenant's lease is up and they leave under circumstances that the reasonable landlord would believe that they vacated the premises as they were supposed to have done when the lease expired, you are legally entitled to go in and clean the apartment.  If you gave him notice about his remaining property and he did not recover it after the 3 months and it was auctioned, you reasonably provided him notice and he is not going to have much of an argument here either.<br/>NY has no statutory law on this, it is all based on case by case basis in court.  Under New York law, an obligation is imposed upon the owner to provide the former tenant with notice and a reasonable opportunity to recover his property, you have done so and that is your defense.  Further in your defense is the tenant left upon expiration of the lease, so there was no longer a lease and the reasonable landlord would expect that someone leaving upon expiration without any notice to the landlord has vacated the premises.<br/>NY courts look at these cases based on a case by case basis and individual facts of each case, so you have enough to show you reasonably believed the premises was abandoned based on the garbage all over and the lease expiring and the tenant not providing any notice they intended to renew and vacating the premises.  As far as the property, you have given him notice and he failed to claim the property in 3 months and as such that was fault of the tenant.</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionCustomer"">THANK YOU....Is there statute or case law that requires a landlord to take action eliminate or reduce a dangerous condition?

I'm sorry to hear that this happened.<br/>Under New York law, I'm sorry to say, they could demand their property, no matter how long your driveway has been across the line. There is a law that allows people who have occupied property for a considerable amount of time to claim ownership, but that law explicitly does not apply to boundary disputes between neighbors. N.Y. Real Prop. Laws and Rules, Section 543.<br/>One option is to move the driveway. The other is to offer to purchase the land under your driveway from the neighbors, thereby moving the property line. One way to determine a price is to calculate the value per square foot of the property times the size of the driveway. But you can also consider the expense of moving your driveway when trying to figure out how much you're willing to pay them.<br/>There is also an option of waiting to see what the neighbors do, but you may still want to have an idea of what you want to do before they contact you.<br/>If you have any questions or concerns about my response, please reply WITHOUT RATING.

My name is ***** ***** I look forward to helping you!<br/>Unfortunately, if they will not leave voluntarily, you do need to go through the legal process to avoid being accused of an illegal eviction.  When there is no lease, the occupant is considered an “at will” tenant and treated legally as a month to month tenant even if they took occupancy without consent.   As such, you can terminate this tenancy by giving written notice of at least 30 days. If they do not leave voluntarily, under New York law, you will then need to give a 3-Day Notice to Quit...meaning they must vacate the premises within that period or face formal eviction. Then, if they still have not left, you will have to file a petition for an eviction order. Once that is granted...you can have the sheriff evict. Unfortunately, you are not allowed to move their stuff out, change the locks, or take any other means of ""self-help"" eviction prior to obtaining the eviction order. In the interim, if he poses any threat to your property, you can get a restraining order to get them out of the house immediately while the eviction process runs its course and you can skip the 30 day notice period and go directly to the 3-day Notice to Quit.<br/>This is the part of my job I don't like...when the law is not in favor of my customer.

The fact that they are down the line of priority just means that they will need to pay off the liens in higher priority to get title.<br/><br/>The good news is that the NY foreclosure time line is one of the longest of all the states.  You are looking at a couple of years before you lose the house.<br/><br/>You will have the opportunity, in the meantime, to pay off the defaulted loan.<br/><br/><p>Reinstatement is when the borrower pays the past-due amounts on the  mortgage, plus all costs and fees, in order to bring a delinquent loan  current.</p><p>New York law provides that the homeowner may reinstate the loan at  any time prior to final judgment. The homeowner can also pay the  arrearage after judgment, but before the sale, and the proceedings will  be stayed (postponed).

You would need to wait until the bank begins foreclosure to respond.<br/>As far as attorney fees, it is whatever you can negotiate.  Assume, at least $1000 and up depending on what is involved.<br/>If you are able to pay off the loan, the amount due will include costs and fees of foreclosure by the by the bank which will likely be around 3500-5000.<br/>Best regards.<br/>Loren</div>]"

Can the spouse or law come after my teachers pension ? New York law</div>]","[<div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionExpert"">Hi,<br/><br/>My name is ***** ***** I'd be happy to answer your questions today.<br/><br/>Both spouses are responsible on the mortgage and the taxes unless or until their name is ***** ***** the property. Usually in a divorce, the spouse that gets the house also gets the attached debts. If the spouse can't afford the house or doesn't want it, the two of you can agree to sell it and split any equity. So, unless the judge orders otherwise, your spouse wouldn't have a cause of action against you. It really comes down to what the divorce decree says.<br/><br/>Your spouse may have a right to a portion of your pension as part of the property distribution or spousal support, but that's a separate issue that has nothing to do with the house. It depends on whether you were working as a teacher during the marriage.<br/><br/>As far as the bank or the city taxes, if the debt isn't paid, the property will be foreclosed and sold. The tax debt follows the property to the new owner. The law does allow the bank to get a judgment against you and your spouse for any remaining balance due, but your pension is protected. New York law does not allow a creditor to take a pension for anything other than child support, unpaid taxes, or spousal support.<br/><br/>If you have any questions or concerns about what I've written, please reply without rating so I may address them. It's important that you are 100% satisfied with my courtesy and professionalism.

Can they be frozen or otherwise held from me ? Would the spouse be able to sue me for damages to his credit or abandonment ?</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionExpert"">Judgment will hurt your credit. Any NON-retirement accounts could be taken. Funds in your checking account that aren't from your pension can be taken.<br/><br/>The divorce court judge will take care of the house. He'll decide who gets the house, and the debt, and then neither of you can sue the other unless you're not doing what you were ordered to do. He'd need a court order to force you to make payments. And ""abandonment"" isn't a cause of action. It may be a grounds for divorce, but it's rarely used when the parties are already planning to divorce at the time one of them moves out.</div>]"

It is correct that if you merely bought your unit from the developer, and it was the developer who hired the construction company to build the project, that you could not sue the contractor directly because you were not in privity of contract with them.  You would have to sue the party who sold the property to you based on a claim that they knowingly sold you a defective product.  This would be a contract action against the developer---but not against the General Contractor or the architect.<br/><br/>Under the circumstances you describe, you would have 6 years in which to sue the developer from whom you bought your residence for the defects in the property to gain compensation for those defects.  The time in which to sue based on the <strong>Breach of Contract</strong> runs from the date the sale closed escrow and you became the new owner.<br/><br/>The family member who was struck and injured by the falling ceiling would sue the contractor for<strong> Negligence</strong> in creating a dangerous condition.

My name is ***** ***** I'll be the attorney assisting you.<br/>It does make a HUGE difference.<br/>A ""choice of law"" or ""governing law"" provision in a contract allows the parties to agree that a particular state's laws will be used to interpret the agreement, even if they live in (or the agreement is signed in) a different state. For example, many big corporations choose Delaware law in their contracts' choice of law provisions, because that state's laws often favor corporations and offer some predictability when it comes to disputes.<br/>Let's say you're a potato farmer in Michigan, and you're entering into a contract with a chain of food stores. Can you request that any disputes under your contract be decided under Idaho law (which you suspect favors potato farmers) even though neither party has anything to do with Idaho? That depends.<br/>In this example, using Idaho law may not fly because courts usually look for some connection between the chosen state and either the transaction (let's say the contract was signed there) or the parties (one of the parties operates a business in the state, for example). A choice of law provision may also run into problems if it appears in an insurance contract, because some states want to make sure their consumer protection laws relating to insurance apply to those within their borders. (Massachusetts, for example, prohibits choice of law provisions in insurance contracts.) Some contracts involving secured transactions and the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) may also conflict with choice of law rules. Also, contracts governing corporate behavior usually must be decided by the law of the state of incorporation. Generally, however, the differences in state law are not great enough to make this a major negotiating issue for most parties.<br/>Jurisdiction refers to where a dispute will be resolved; governing law indicates which state's law will be used to decide the dispute. It's possible, for example, for a contract to require lawsuits to be filed in California but decided under New York law. The selection of which state is used for governing law is not often a crucial negotiating issue. But the selection of the state for jurisdiction can be more important: If there's a dispute, that's where everyone will have to go to resolve it. Sometimes these two provisions are grouped into one paragraph. [nolo.com]<br/>You stated and asked:<br/>I am signing Non Circumvention non disclosure agreements, and wanted to know if it matters what state should be on the document.<br/>Answer:<br/>As stated above - it makes a huge difference potentially because, if not CA, then you can expect to defend where the contract stipulates the jurisdiction is to be. That could place you at a huge disadvantage having to travel to NY for example.<br/>You want the ""choice of law"" clause to be as favorable to you as possible - in your backyard (ie. CA) and the governing law to be as favorable to you as possible. I again would choose CA if I were you.<br/>Please be kind enough to rate Excellent Service"" so that I receive credit for assisting you, it will not cost you anything additional to leave a positive rating, and that is the only way I can receive credit, Thank you for understanding,<br/>If you receive a Customer Satisfaction Survey from JustAnswer, Please rate a 10 as it gives me a greater opportunity to assist other customers on this website and is greatly appreciated,<br/>Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to assist you,<br/>Fred</div>]"

I look forward to working with you to provide you the information you are seeking for educational purposes only.<br/><br/>Unless your commercial lease agreement has a clause allowing the landlord to use self help, you cannot exercise a lockout.  Your tenant is in breach of lease, so you need to give them written notice of their breach and you need to inform them they have to cure the breach or leave the premises.  You need to tell them failure to cure would result in eviction.  In a commercial tenancy must be sued for in the civil court not the housing court, as housing court is for residential eviction.<br/><br/>Thus, start by giving the tenant a written notice that they are in breach of the lease not accepting your packages and that if they continue you will proceed to evict them for breach of lease.  If they continue to refuse your packages, then you need to give them 30 day notice to evict for breach of lease and if they do not do so then absent a written clause in your lease allowing self-help (lock out) you have to file suit for unlawful detainer/breach of lease in the civil court and serve them the suit and go to court to have the court order them to evict.<br/><br/>The letter to them informing them they are in breach and can be evicted would be your other option to try to get them to change their behavior.<br/><br/><br/><br/><hr/> <p class=""MsoNormal""><em>I                                                                                  truly    aim to  please   you    as  a                            customer,             but            please             keep   in              mind               that  I                                      do           not  know              what  you                  already      know           or                    don't     know,      or            with          what                       you                                 need       help,         unless       you              tell       me.

My goal is to do my very best to understand your situation and to provide a full and complete answer for you.<br/><br/><br/>Good evening.  Yes, you can get her out, but, unfortunately, you do need to go through the legal process to avoid being accused of an illegal eviction. Even though there is no lease and if a person is intended to be just a guest, after that person has been in occupancy for more than a couple of weeks, that person becomes an ""at will"" tenant even though paying nothing. Such a person is deemed to be a month to month tenant. As such, you can terminate this tenancy by giving written notice of at least 30 days. If she does not leave voluntarily, under New York law, you will then need to give a 3-Day Notice to Quit...meaning she must vacate the premises within that period or face formal eviction. Then, if she still has not left, you will have to file a petition for an eviction order. Once that is granted...you can have the sheriff evict. Unfortunately, you are not allowed to move her stuff out, change the locks, or take any other means of ""self-help"" eviction prior to obtaining the eviction order. In the interim, if she poses any threat to your person or property, you can get a restraining order to get her out of the house immediately while the eviction process runs its course. <br/><br/><br/><br/>This is the part of my job I don't like...when the law is not in favor of my customer. I wish I could tell you that you could just force her out immediately, but I can only provide you information based on the law so that you can act on the best available information to you. ………..I wish I had better news, but can only hope you recognize and understand my predicament and don't shoot the messenger.

However, that does not excuse his overall behavior.<br/><br/>In cases like these, a <i>cease and desist</i> letter from an attorney to them is likely to do the trick.  The cease and desist can threaten to sue for (1) defamation and (2) intentional infliction of emotional distress.<br/><br/>Under New York law, the elements of a <b>defamation</b> claim are: a false statement; published to a third party without privilege or authorization; with fault amounting to at least negligence; that caused special harm or defamation per se. <i>See Dillon v. City of New York, 261 A.D.2d 34, 38 (N.Y.A.D. 1 Dept. 1999).</i><br/><br/><b>IIoED</b> has four elements: (i) extreme and outrageous conduct; (ii) intent to cause, or disregard of a substantial probability of causing, severe emotional distress; (iii) a causal connection between the conduct and injury; and (iv) severe emotional distress. The first element — outrageous conduct — serves the dual function of filtering out petty and trivial complaints that do not belong in court, and assuring that plaintiff's claim of severe emotional distress is genuine <i>(see, Prosser, Insult and Outrage, 44 Cal L Rev, at 44-45; compare, Mitchell v Rochester Ry Co., 151 NY, at 110).</i><br/><br/>Now, this is more of a bluff than anything.  In reality, your case may be weaker than the letter would make it out to be.  However, this may scare them enough to stop, without even having to resort to litigation.

You cannot be lawfully locked out without a court order. If the doorman attempts to prevent you from entering into your home, call 911.<br/><br/>In order to evict you, the landlord first needs to send you a written notice of termination with no less than 30 days written notice.  If you do not vacated the end of that period of time, the landlord will need to file an unlawful detainer action to evict you.  At that time you can answer the unlawful detainer complaint with your defenses and be heard in court.<br/><br/>Does this make sense to you?</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionCustomer"">I just wrote it.

New York law requires that you be treated as a tenant regardless of whether you have a lease. A landlord or management company who acts to simply prevent a tenant from entering or changes the locks can be held civilly and criminally liable<br/><br/>I have another business commitment and will be away from the computer for the next 2 hours.

"[<div class=""qnaBoxTitle""><h1> <!-- -->I want to know about adverse possession in NYC queens. I saw a home and I did some research on it and the owner had</h1></div>, <div class=""qnaBoxFirstChat""><strong> Customer: </strong> I want to know about adverse possession in NYC queens.  I saw a home and I did some research on it and the owner had abandon this house for 10 years and during that time the city had given it some violations.  Sanitation health cleanups and extreminting.  They also brick the doors and windows except for a sliding door on the second floor which is half way  open and not totally secure.  My plan is to go into the house and break the bricks.  Wll that be consider trepassing?  The owner died Janaury of 2010 and there is no heirs.  I need to know what exactly do I need to do when I take adverse possession of a house.  If not this one due to the bricks and possible trespassing then I will find another in the near future.  I want to know from start to finish what paper work and where can I get it that I need to file?  I am aware that it takes 10 years to get title of this home.  I do not might hiring a lawyer once I know exactly what I need to do. Also is there anyway I can just ask for the deed to this property being that the owner is dead and there are no heir?  It does have back taxes around $50,000.  If you can not answer my questions in detail please do not answer.  I will not pay for incomplete answers that does not help with the adverse possession of a house.</div>]","[<div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionExpert"">Hi,<br/><br/>My name is XXXXX XXXXX I'd be happy to answer your questions today.<br/><br/>A person who claims title to property by adverse possession is trespassing up until the day he gets a judgment that declares him the owner.  So, yes, you would be trespassing if you entered, even if your eventual goal was to become the owner.<br/><br/>Under New York law, adverse possession requires that a person occupy the property continuously, exclusively, without the owner's permission, for ten years.  See N.Y. Civ. Prac. Laws &amp; Rules, Section 212 and N.Y. Real Actions &amp; Proceedings Laws, Section 521.  The law also requires ""acts sufficiently open to put a reasonably   diligent owner on notice.""  N.Y. Real Actions &amp; Proceedings Laws, Section 522. So, you can't hide every time the real owner comes by to look at the place.  The legal term is ""open and notorious"" possession.<br/><br/>The fact that the property has been empty for the past ten years is irrelevant if you have not actually lived there during that time period, because possession is absolutely required.  So, to gain title to the property via adverse possession, you need to move in and live there for ten years.  But, you also need to find out who now legally owns the property, because a person cannot adversely possess property against the state, and if the true owner has no will and absolutely no heirs, the property will go to the state.  In that case, you can't adversely possess it.  You can make an offer to purchase the property - that is certainly much easier, as you don't run the risk that you'll put money into the property for ten years and get nothing in return, or be charged with criminal trespassing.<br/><br/>Also, if there are significant back taxes owed, the city may foreclose, and you could buy the property at the tax sale.  That is another option that might benefit you, because, if you wanted to buy the house, those taxes would have to be paid, anyway.</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionCustomer"">You only answered on question and not specific to my situation.  I know about the law as it pertain to adverse possession.  But they are squatte rights that is not consider trespassing on a vacant property.  That is what I will be doing as for this property it is brick up and I was looking to see if I break the brick will that be trespassing?  When it is not the case if the house is vacant and I wanted to take up shop and there is not bricks. What I really wanted to know is the process of adverse possession from start to finish.  This includes filing any paperwork (the name of the paperwork) and where to file it and where do I get the paperwork?  Also when do I file before, whilie I am in the property or after the I live there for 10 years.  This is the details that ask for please provide details not section from the law.  Thank you</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionExpert"">It's all trespassing.  ""Squatter's rights"" as most people understand them is essentially a myth.  The only way to get squatter's rights is through adverse possession, and it takes several years.  Entering the property at all, for any reason, is trespassing - no matter what you call yourself.  Taking items from the property is stealing.  Entering the house itself, as opposed to just walking on the lawn, is breaking and entering.  It's all illegal.<br/><br/>The purpose of the adverse possession statutes is to punish a landowner who can't be bothered to pay attention to his property and so doesn't notice that someone else is living there.  It can also be used where a person believes he has title to the property, but there's some problem that means that he doesn't.  It really wasn't intended to be used as a means of acquiring property, so everything that the adverse possessor does is illegal for the first ten years. <br/><br/>You can't bring an action to claim the property until you've lived there for ten years, because you don't have any claim to the property until that time period has expired.   So, if you tried to file now, the owners would just have you evicted.  That also gives you ten years to figure out who the owner is.  The process is very simple:  Move in, don't get caught, stay there, then sue after ten years have gone by.  It's called a Quiet Title Action, and it's started by filing a Summons and Complaint, but you have quite a bit of time before you can do it.</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionCustomer""><p>Thank you just want to clearify you do not have to get an afitidavt for adverse possession like in other states like Texas.  If I got this right you stay they and act as if this your home for 10 years and then when the time is up you file a summons and complaint for a Quiet Title Action.  Where at that time I can hire a lawyer.  At this time I do not need a lawyer because I have not been there for 10 years.  Do I have this right?   I will be more pay after you have confirm the process.  Sorry it took so long to get back to you had to go out.  Thank you.</p></div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionExpert"">You have it right.  There is no point in hiring a lawyer now, because you can't bring the action until you've been there ten years.  Usually, you would hire a lawyer when you're ready to file suit - so, when the ten years is almost up.  Or, if they try to remove you from the property before that time, then you might want to talk to a lawyer when that happens.  For now, though, you don't need to hire a lawyer.</div>]"

After reading my answer, please do not hesitate to reply if you have additional questions or need more information.<br/><br/>Reasonable notice isn't defined under New York law with respect to tenant rights. However, a tenant does have a right to privacy, and while a landlord does have the right to enter and make repairs, or show the home for example, it must be balanced against the tenant's rights. Reasonable notice is generally considered to be 24 hours, unless the landlord has to enter the apartment for an emergency, in which case, they can enter without notice. Taking walk-in clients up to the home to show it immediately is not an emergency, and giving 10 minutes notice is not reasonable. If a person is a walk-in, they should be scheduled a time to come back so that notice can be given to your son.<br/><br/>While he is not permitted to change the locks, if he has tried to amicably resolve the matter without success, he can seek a restraining order against the landlord to keep them from entering without notice. He could also sue the landlord in housing court for harassment; the court can impose civil penalties against the landlord as a result.<br/><br/>This <a href=""http://www.ag.ny.gov/bureaus/real_estate_finance/pdfs/tenants_rights_guide.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">tenant's guide</a> for New York State may be helpful to your son as well, and includes phone numbers to resources such as the county public services commission which may also be able to offer him some more guidance or assistance. <br/><br/> <br/></p><p>*****************************************************************************************************</p><p><strong>JUST ANSWER IS A ""PAY FOR"" SERVICE. <u>As I do this for a living, not a hobby</u>, please honor and respect the honor code and pay me as you would any other professional. </strong><br/><br/><strong><u>DISCLAIMER:</u></strong> This response is limited by the information that you have provided to this lawyer.

Even if 24 hours is considered unreasonable, there is NO way a court would ever agree that giving 10 minutes notice and showing up at your son's door and seeking to enter is reasonable. What if his home was messy? What if he had animals loose? What if he had people over? Similarly, a court is not going to find it reasonable for a landlord to tell your son ""we may enter every day, so the home should be ready."" That's an invasion of the right to privacy and a landlord who constantlyshows up without reasonable notice could be considered harassing a tenant. </p></div>]"

"[<div class=""qnaBoxTitle""><h1> <!-- -->I live Island NY &amp; we are currently trying to modify the mortgages on the house. My wife and I were married at the time</h1></div>, <div class=""qnaBoxFirstChat""><strong> Customer: </strong> Hi, I live Long Island NY &amp; we are currently trying to modify the mortgages on the house.<br/><br/>My wife and I were married at the time we bought the home, but the mortgage was only in my name. My wife never signed any of the papers, nor did she sign for the 2nd mortgage. I retained a lawyer to modify the loan and paid their fee. I am very concerned, it's been over 2 weeks now and I have not heard back. The reason for modification was because I had a blood disorder, there was thrombosis (blood clot) and adema and the medicine really, really set me back. I keeped up the payments with no  income but my wife's and my retirement savings, which I heard was a mistake. I am self employed ironically as an investment advisor.<br/><br/>Recently I read an article were a couple in Iowa won a decision in court making the mortgage unenforceble due to a law which states that a married couple must sign a mortgage contract jointly and the husband signed all of his wife's signatures, which made the mortgage void. They concluded that they now own the home free and clear.<br/><br/>My intentions were honest, I never meant to cut my wife out of anything. The mortgage companies all knew I was married (they had a copy of our tax returns and she was present at the closing). The mortgage company was New Century Mortgage(Carrington Mortgage now)  and my rate since 2007-2009 was 9.75%. This was higher before, but with some calls they decreased it. They reduced it to 6.5% on Jan 2010.<br/><br/>My concerns are:<br/>-Could the Mortgage Co signed my wife's name on the docs<br/>-Could they enforce the Mortgage and begin foreclosure. Although, we have not been given any future forclosure dates and our laywer say's there is a cease &amp; decist order until modification.<br/>-Can I (or is there) any such law, that can make these mortgages void<br/>-The house is worth $442,000 according to Zillow. The last statement I recieved stated a total loan value of $475,000 + the 2nd mortgage which is $48,000, and the mortgage company has not escrowed the RE taxes which are $10,000 a year making the total debt $533,000. I originally bought the house in 2005 for $452,000. the house was a fixer upper and put down $80,000. We took the proceeds of the other house $180,00 profit and used it to fix the place to be respectible, it still needs work. But, we decided to defer improvements in early 2006.<br/>- I have two small children and their pre-school is $2,000 a month, but this will end soon as they will attend public school next year. I have finally feel better and business got off to a good start this year, but shows growing pains. We love our home, but is there any hope of us keeping it.<br/>-I need an unbiased opinion because I know that my attorney is honest, but has also been paid $4,000.00 upfront. I fear that our situation may not be so easy for him and I  he could divert his attention elsewhere.<br/>- What can/should do at this point.<br/><br/>DR</div>]","[<div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionExpert"">If the lender is going to modify the loan, they are going to want your wife to sign the necessary docs. Moreover, the story from Iowa involved Iowa law, not New York law. In addition, as you stated above, the husband signed his wife's name which is illegal, unless he had power of attorney. The loan modification process takes time, so it is not uncommon that the lender has not responded within 2 weeks. However, your attorney should remain in contact with you and advise as to what is going on. When the lender is to consider a loan modification, they want to make sure if they do this, that you have the income to pay each month. There is no point in modifying a loan only for the borrowers to not be able to pay. The lender is going to want to see a surplus of monthly income or a very slight deficit. If so, they may be willing to give you a trial modification.</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionExpert"">Please see above</div>]"

Also, by ""minus"", what do you mean--where do you want to remove the amount from?</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionCustomer"">My dad gave me $88K to pay off the mortgage for our house (wife and me). I plan to buy the house from my wife. (She walked out). I want to keep the house. For example the house valued $250K. I have to pay her $125K, but my dad helped me ($88K). It should be $125K minus $88K = $37K. I pay only $37K to her.</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionExpert"">Thank you for your follow-up.<br/><br/>No, it does not work that way--even if you received third party funds to pay for it, the profit does not change UNLESS that amount was a written loan that can be proven at the time of purchase. In that situation, if you owe her a portion of the home value, you can figure out the value of her share a bit differently.  Let me explain.<br/><br/>Example:  The home is worth $250.  You put in $100K (just to make it easy).  Upon sale you get your $100K back, and then the profit (the $150K) is split 50-50 between you both.

I will explain more. During closing (Dad's house), my lawyer wrote a check of $144K to my name. I deposited it into joint account for few days. $88K to mortgagor and $56K to my brother.

Each gets $81K from sale of home.</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionExpert"">Thank you for your follow-up.<br/><br/>That is absolutely correct.  Your deposit into the home is returned back.  Since you put in $88K as your investment, that you can demand be returned first.  Then, whatever is left is considered to be a marital asset as it is a joint growth in profit on the home.  Whatever is left (after paying you back, and possibly covering any outstanding lien or mortgages), is then split 50/50 between the spouses.<br/><br/>Example 1.  The home is owned free and clear.  You put in $88K.  Home is sold for $250K.  You get your $88K back, and the remainder of $162K is deemed to be profit.  Profit is split 50/50 or $81K to each spouse.<br/><br/>Example 2.  The home has a mortgage of $50K outstanding.  You put in $88K.  Home is sold for $250K.  The mortgage company gets the $50K back first, then you get your $88K back.

With a little more information, I might be able to expand upon my answer.</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionCustomer""><p>Sure I have been living without a stove for a year now, the stove has literally blown up 3 times, and he is an absent landlord so there were alot of issues were we couldnt contact him and ended up fixing things ourself, he is rude when he enters our home and swears he smelled marijuana in our apartment and proceeded to ask all our neighbors in the triplex if they smell pot and even went as far as to have him the police and an investigator search my apartment one day, with my 21 month old and 11 year old here.  Of coarse they found nothing and appologized, but this is all in reltaliation of a letter of repair i sent him on june 1st, i had had enough and it was answered with an eviction notice. So far he has fixed a couple things at the urging of my local building inspector for the town and the tree that I put in my letter of repair that needed to be address actually did fall and hour after my neighbor was mowing and me and my kids were playing outside. But he still absolutely refuses to fix my stove and anything else. So when i got the eviction notice which is his right cause we are month to month and we are withholding rent, i am countersueing for breach of habitality, unjust enrichment, harrassment, and retaliation. So i sent a letter cert. to him requesting all repair records, I'm sueing him for 3000.00 we pay 825.00 and i access the apartment at 525.00 for a year with no stove, unfixed leaks, no lighting working, and its the maximum you can sue in N.Y. court of eviction, so I have two questions actually, can i get repair records, and my neighbors are my best witnesses cause they are going threw the same with him not fixing anything but i dont want to have them involved cause there all month to month, now the landlord says they are the ones complaining, but they tell me they are being asked and havent complained, will the judge take affadavits from them stating this?</p></div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionExpert"">You should do a Request for Production with your lawsuit and ask that he produce to you all repair records for your home from the periods of _______ to __________ (whatever they are).  He would have to respond to a production request, but he doesn't have to respond to a certified letter. But also consider that if he's claiming the apartment is in working order, and that he's made repairs, he should bring that information to court with him, too.<br/><br/>I would also suggest you take pictures of your home, and the conditions, and if you have or can get repair estimates for non-functioning items like the stove, those would be good to have too when you go to court. New York law actually does give you the right to ""repair and deduct"", that is, have something fixed in your home if the landlord refuses to fix it and then deduct the amount from your rent, presuming the cost is reasonable.  <br/><br/>The affidavits are acceptable, but honestly, it would be better if the neighbors who write affidavits are available to testify in court at the hearing. Anyone can sign and have an affidavit notarized, so the judge won't give it as much weight as if they would also be available to give live testimony.</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionCustomer"">How would it work if I'm already sueing for 3000.00 which is the maximum, if i repair things and deduct do i deduct it from the security i gave him which is the last months rent or is it even worth it at this point since i'm being evicted. These are things he is going to have to fix anyways in order for it to be rentable. So do you think I should just go with the estimate of repairs to show all these things are indeed broken.</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionExpert"">At this point, I would agree it probably doesn't make sense to repair and deduct. Even if the court agrees with you, and finds there is no basis for an eviction, something tells me you don't plan on staying! But just keep in mind that is an option for you in the future should something like this come up again.<br/><br/>Yes, I would suggest getting the estimates from repair companies to show that the items are broken and in need of repair, and I would also take pictures of things. Pictures paint 1,000 words, as they say.</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionCustomer"">Do you think this is a case were you could asdk for triple damages? Or is that something a judge decides while awarding you or do you have to request it.</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionExpert"">No, triple damages is reserved for cases when the landlord uses forceful or wrongful means to evict you, such as by locking you out of the house or threatening you with violence if you don't leave the home.</div>]"

I will post a detailed answer for answer for you as soon as the deposition concludes.</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionCustomer"">Thank You</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionExpert"">Thank you for your patience.  <br/><br/>Since your mother previously received STAR, the issue of ownership was determined and decided at the time the initial application was made  If your mother did not possess the deed to her property at that time, other documents may have been used to determine eligibility.  Those documents likely include tax records which will show your mother's long history of tax payments, as well as tax bills presumably sent to your mother as the ""owner"" of the property.  There may be other documents to establish ownership, as well, such as prior ownership documents and family records.  The fact that there has been no other claim to ownership of the property is also a fact that can be used to your mother's benefit. <br/><br/>Note the following passage from the STAR Assessor's Guide, School Tax Relief (STAR) Exemption, New York State Board of Real Property Services:<br/><br/> <u><strong><a name=""owner"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""owner""></a>""OWNERSHIP</strong></u> <strong><br/>Question:</strong>  Must a copy of the deed be submitted with the STAR application? 	 <p><strong>Answer:</strong> No, a copy of the deed is not generally required. The assessor must be satisfied, however, that the applicant is the owner. In most cases, it should be sufficient to check the tax records.""</p><p> </p><p>This passage may be accessed by following this link: </p><p> </p><p>http://www.orps.state.ny.us/star/assessorguide.htm#owner</p><p> </p><p>From there, click on the ""ownership"" link.  </p><p> </p>I recommend contacting the person whose signature appears on the rejection letter at the number provided by the Department of Taxation and Finance, Office of Real Property Tax Services.  Point out the passage, above.  If you do not get anywhere with that person, request to speak with a supervisor.  The supervisor should have a better understanding of the process and will likely correct the situation, immediately.  <br/><br/>If necessary, you can also point to the fact that even if ownership of the home cannot be established by deed, under current New York law, as articulated by the Court of Appeals in June 2006 in the case of <em>Walling v. Przybylo</em>, a claim of adverse possession can be made if an individual “openly, notoriously and exclusively” uses someone else’s property continuously for 10 years, believing he has the right to do so.  A successful claim of adverse possession grants ownership to the person claiming the property as his/her own.  This is something that a supervisor may understand more so than a general representative. This is a valid argument, but it is unlikely that you will need to use it. <br/><br/>If all else fails discuss the matter with the legal department.  There is no question that the State's own attorneys will have a clear understanding of the law. <br/><br/> If you feel uncomfortable handling these issues on your own, you may contact the New York State Bar Association at www.nysba.org for a referral to an attorney in your area who can handle the negotiatons for you.  If you explain the situation and let the referral center know your mother's age, you may be referred to an attorney who will provide assistance at no charge.<br/><br/>Again, I think that pointing to the State's own manual regarding proof of ownership requirements will quickly solve the problem.<br/><br/>Best of luck!<br/><br/>-------------------------------------<br/><br/>IF THIS ANSWER WAS HELPFUL, PLEASE REMEMBER TO CLICK ""ACCEPT.""

However, the landlord cannot base the difference in rent on the tenant`s race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability or family status.

Again the question, how could the source of the infestation NOT, on some level, be the owner's ""personal property""?

New York law allows a senior citizen with a medical condition to terminate their lease due to a medical condition if they are moving in with a family member for a period of at least 6 months (it requires a letter from a doctor stating the tenant can no longer live independently and a statement from the family member that the tenant plans to move in with them) or into an adult day care facility.

If the landlord does not, then the vacating tenant cannot be held liable for rent beyond the time a replacement tenant could have been found had the landlord used reasonable efforts.  Thus, the more notice you can give, the better.<br/><br/>""Reasonable efforts"" is a vague concept that hinges on the local rental market conditions and standards.  Typically, a landlord will have to show that they did things  like posted a newspaper ad.  In addition, courts usually find that at tenants, even where there was a failure to mitigate, are liable for at least one to two months of rent.  Thus, if you can give at least a month or two notice before moving out, then  you increase your chances of vacating without liability.<br/><br/>Please understand that this is your ""best case"" scenario.  New York courts are increasingly landlord friendly, with recent decisions weakening the duty to mitigate.  Again, the best thing that you can do is provide as much notice as possible in the hopes that it motivates your landlord and your roommate to find a replacement.<br/><br/>Please let me know, if you have follow-up questions.</div>]"

You are referring to the bank and not the corporation. The bank closed and no longer existed at the end of the receivership. <br/><br/><br/>I should note that this does not mean a suit cannot be commenced in the name of the entity necessarily. For example, a dissolved corporation may commence a suit in its name up to two years after dissolution under New York law. This is not a corporation, but there may be a similar basis for commencing a suit in the name of the closed banking institution. <br/><br/>It is unclear if this was a mortgage assumed by a different bank. The receiver, if this is who filed suit, has up to six years to file a suit based on a contract claim. See page seven of the following: http://www.fdic.gov/bank/historical/reshandbook/ch7recvr.pdf<br/><br/>If the loan was transfered along with the other assets of the company, then the named plaintiff is improper it appears. In that case, you should have been notified of the transfer of the loan prior and the suit should have been commenced in the name of the bank currently holding the loan. I am not sure if this answered all of your questions, but it should help you ask additional questions of the plaintiff to determine if the correct party is named.<br/><br/>Thank you <br/><br/>Please click on the ACCEPT button for my answer so  that I  receive credit for assisting you.

If your tenant will not leave voluntarily, you must follow the New York law regarding an eviction.   An eviction is a court case that a landlord must file to remove a tenant from a rented apartment or house. If you have lived in a rooming house or hotel for at least 30 days, the landlord must use the eviction process to make you move. <blockquote><p>An eviction case, which lawyers call a Summary Proceeding, is started when the landlord has someone else serve the tenant with 2 papers, the ""Notice of Petition"" (tells the time, date, and place of court hearing) and the ""Petition"" (tells the reason the landlord wants to evict). The tenant must be served with both of these papers at least 5 days before the court date, and the court date can't be later than 12 days after the tenant is served. </p><p>Just because a landlord starts an eviction action doesn't mean that the landlord will win. Tenants have certain rights, and there are several defenses to an eviction action. </p></blockquote><blockquote><p>You may not use self-help.  The landlord must go to court, must win the case, and must get a court order called the ""Warrant of Eviction"". This is true even if the tenant owes rent or the lease has ended.<br/><br/>It is a criminal violation for a landlord to illegally evict a tenant by:</p></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>* Changing the locks,<br/>* Padlocking the doors,<br/>* Taking out furniture or property,<br/>* Removing the door,<br/>* Turning off the electricity or water,<br/>* Doing anything else that keeps the tenant out of the house or apartment (Real Property Law Section 235). </p></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><p> </p><p><em>I hope this has given you the guidance you were seeking.

What are my parents options since my uncle doesn't care about the house but giving my parents headaches after headaches.  Even renting to bad renters.<br/><br/>Thank you.</div>]","[<div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionExpert"">All joint owners in real estate have a legal obligation under New York law to contribute to the maintenance of the property and to prevent from committing ""waste"" (allowing the property to deteriorate under their care).<br/><br/>So, not only should  your parents take measures to maintain the property, they will be required to do so under law.  However, the uncle is obligated to contribute his share to such expenditures.  If he does not, your parents can recover the amounts from his share of any proceeds.  These proceeds can either come from renting the property or from the sale of the property.<br/><br/>If things continue to deteriorate between your parents and your uncle, you parents can force a sale of the property through a legal action called ""partition"".  The court will then force the property to be sold and divide the proceeds of the sale among the owners, taking into consideration any extra payments made by your parents.<br/><br/>Furthermore, as owners, your parents have the right to evict tenants who are in breach of their lease and rerent the property to renters of their choice.  Of course, there could be a ""tug-of-war"" between your parents and your uncle as your uncle has the same right.  Ultimately, this too, could be determined by a court.<br/><br/>Please let me know, if you have follow-up questions.</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionCustomer"">Does fixing damaged ceiling by water leak and replacing drafty windows fall under the maintenance law?<br/><br/>Recently, tenants moved out of the 1st floor and my uncle wants to cut the gas service for the 1st floor to save him a few pennies.  But the thing is the 1st floor gas is connected to the basement.  The boiler that provides heat to the whole house runs on gas and will not work once the gas is cut for the 1st floor.  What can my parents do to maintain the gas running for the boiler even though my uncle insist on cutting gas service for the 1st floor?  Will my uncle have any choice but to pay for 1/2 of the expense paid to put the gas separately for the basement and the 1st floor?  Even if that were to happen, 1/2 of the bill for the basement should go to my uncle as well?</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionExpert"">Yes.  Those items fall under the category of maintenance.  If the gas to the first floor serves a common area such as the basement, then he must maintain gas service or pay for an alternative.  Your parents can force either alternative (retaining gas service or paying for an alternative).</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionCustomer"">What if he does not retain gas service and refuse to pay for an alternative?  Paying for an alternative means he pays for 1/2 and my parents pay 1/2 correct?  or does my uncle pay the full alternative since he wanted to go this route?</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionExpert"">It's possible that your parents could force him to pay the full amount, since it is an improvement designed to convenience him (so he can cut off the gas to ""his"" portion of the property).  The standard, however, is for all owners to share in the cost of any improvement to the realty.<br/><br/>If he refuses, your parents would have to take him to court.</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionCustomer"">Hi,<br/><br/>My uncle cut the gas service to the house and would like to proceed to take him to court.  How would I go about doing that?  Would 311 able to help me?  Would I be better off to get myself a Litigation lawyer to settle this whole mess?  What would my estimated cost if I were to get my parents a good Ligigation lawyer?</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionExpert"">Cases like this are messy.  Therefore, the cost is significant.  If your uncle fights, anticipate a minimum of $5,000.  And you will likely need to come up with an up front retainer of at least $2500.<br/><br/>You want an experienced real estate lawyer, which you can find by looking at the New York State Bar Associations website's lawyer referral service.<br/><br/>Your uncle appears to be acting in a self-serving way that has no consideration for the other owners of the property.  However, he also seems to be overly focused on the financial costs of the property.  So, you may be able force him to settle once he learns the financial costs of fighting you.</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionCustomer"">That sounds like a lot of money to spend over something like this.  Will I be able to take him to small claims court for things like this?<br/><br/>Anything we can do to get the gas to be turned back on as soon as possible?  My parents have no heat or hot water after the gas is turned off.<br/><br/>My uncle also insist for my parents to switch the gas over to their name.  Would changing all the utilities name over to my parents exclude my uncle from paying his 1/2 of the bill common charges such as Gas and Electric for the basement?<edited><editdate>40215.947647419</editdate></edited></div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionExpert"">Yes.  Your parents could sue in small claims court.  Yes, your parents could put the gas in their name and force him to pay half.  He's responsible for half, regardless of the person on the actual bill.  And he can't legally turn off the gas when it serves your parents as well.</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionCustomer"">My brother-in-law wanted me to call 911 on my uncle.  So instead of calling 911 directly, I went to the precint to get a confirmation if the police can do anything in situations like this.  The officer I spoke to confirms that my uncle can not legally turn off the gas and will get arrested if he doesn't turn the gas back on.  Since the office in the precient can't confirm that we don't have heat, he said I have to call 911 from the house instead.  Of course, when the officers came.. They said they can't do anything about situations like this since they can't confirm if my uncle possibly have other conflicts which cause the gas to be turned off.  The offices insist that I just get in touch with 311 (Got 2 complaint numbers).  Can the police actually force my uncle to turn the gas back on and get him arrested if he doesn't?  <br/><br/>Truth of the matter is that my parents can get the gas turned on under their name, but this will not fix the problem since tenants will come and go for the 1st floor and it's a pain to keep on having to turn the gas back on when a tenant leaves.  Will taking him to small claims court prevent him from shutting the gas off in the future?  Would you happen to know which small claims court form I'll need to fill out? <br/><br/>Thanks for all the help.  I'll pay you again once this thing is done and over.</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionExpert"">No.  This is a civil dispute, not criminal.  The police won't be able/willing to do anything.<br/><br/>Yes.  A legal action can prevent him from turning it off in the future.  They simply need to request, in their complaint, a ""permanent restraining order"" preventing him from shutting off the gas.<br/><br/>Here is a link with  instructions for small claims court in NY state.<br/><br/>http://www.courts.state.ny.us/courts/nyc/smallclaims/pdfs/smallclaims.pdf<br/><br/>You can get the forms from the clerk of the court.  To start your lawsuit, you will fill out the complaint/statement of claim form.</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionCustomer"">I will be going to the court and file proper forms.  We really don't want to sue him for money, but we do want him to be fair and leave the gas turned on at all times.  If my parents were to sue him for money, how much in cases like this can my parents sue him for?  My parents have no hot water or heat since Friday Feb 5th..  They have to boiled water to take a warm bath and have to buy two electric heaters to keep my 80yr old grandmother warm.  <br/><br/>According to small claims pdf you linked me, it indicates we can't sue for pain and suffering.  Having no hot water or heat fall in that category?</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionExpert"">They can sue for their ""direct"" damages, which would include the cost of the heaters or other ""out of pocket"" expenses.  In a case such as this, the primary award is an ""injunction"" preventing the uncle for taking certain actions or an ""order"" requiring him to take certain actions, or both.</div>]"

In New York, a notice of pendency (New York's version of the lis pendens) can only be filed when the action relates to the real property directly - in other words the basis of the suit arises out of the ownership of the property.  If the person simply owes you money, you will need to obtain a judgment in a court of law.  Once you obtain a judgment and file it in the county in which the real property is located, it will act as a lien.</p><p> </p><p>Filing a notice of pendency without proper basis can result in your being responsible for the property owner's costs and expenses in getting the notice removed.  You could also be held liable for other damages if, say the owner was going to sell the property but could not because of a wrongfully filed notice of pendency.</p><p> </p><p>Please let me know if you need additional clarification.</p></div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionCustomer"">255k from myself and 97k from my stepmom, whom I live with were borrowed from the cousin and his girlfriend to purchase the house in LV. they also owe a house in NY. The agreement was verbal for us to be paid back upon the sale of the NY house. It became clear that we would never be paid back, as I began to notice many, many unauthorized atms in addition to the loan and other fraudulent activity. We realize we may never get the atm monies back, but at least want the money back that they purchased the LV house with. If you need more info, please let me know. I was also told that taking large amounts of money from someone without anything in writing constitues embezzlement.</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionExpert"">You can probably recover in a civil suit, but New York law does not allow a lien to be placed against real property unless the pending suit involves the real property directly.  Without anything in writing, the notice of pendency would probably be considered to be improperly filed.  As I said before, once you have obtained a judgment against the owners of the property, it will act as a lien (the same thing as a lis pendens) once it is filed with the clerk.  Even if you obtain a judgment in another state, you can file it in New York and it will be a lien.</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionCustomer"">thank you. I am obviously not schooled in law, but think I understand. We are in a civil suit against this cousin and his girlfriend. I will talk to a good friend who is helping me and get back to you if I need more info.

Generally, you are required to remain on the premises otherwise, moving out can cause the PSC to cease their investigations on the grounds it is no longer a concern affecting you.  Again, this is something you need to ask the PSC.<br/><br/>As to the threats and harassment, the landlord cannot retaliate against you for asserting a claim with the PSC.  As such the landlord is violating the lease agreement of the implied duty of quiet enjoyment.  You have the option of suing the landlord for violating this implied duty.  In addition any unwarranted harassment is a criminal offense which is reportable to law enforcement to put a stop to the landlord's conduct.<br/><br/>I doubt the landlord would pursue to take legal action against you, since you can counter-sue for retaliation, breach of the implied duty of quiet enjoyment and harassment, which will not look good if the judge where to hear the case.  However, given that your landlord is acting in an offensive manner, I would recommend that you retain an attorney to at least issue a cease and desist letter and place the landlord on notice of your rights.

I need to break my 1-year lease that began mid-February (9 months complete). The landlord is unwilling to negotiate any type of penalty other than what's in the lease (which is that I'm responsible for the entire lease - $7200). I've shown the apartment to nearly 40 people trying to get new tenants but no one will take it, in a large part because the apartment needs updates and the management company is listing similar apartments in the building and a building down the street for hundreds of dollars less. The landlord is inflexible on the listing price, and after I asked about negotiating the penalty now insists that I list the apartment at an increased rent.<br/><br/>I asked the landlord for some repairs and asked them to schedule a time with me (in writing). Instead, they accessed my apartment without my permission, presence, or notification. They say I verbally agreed to this, which is not true. <br/><br/>MY QUESTION is: Is this breach of privacy (which, as a clause in my lease as well as New York law, states Owner must notify or have my permission/presence to access apartment for non-emergencies) enough to terminate the lease early (the lease states owner and tenant must do everything they agree to in the lease)?<br/><br/>I understand this is really thin, and that my credibility will be a huge factor in a judge's decision. But I'm wondering if it's enough to terminate the lease early and whether I stand any chance if they pursue this in court. At the very least, do you know of any cases where this has been argued? My thought is that the landlord's insistance on adhering to the letter of the contract should mean that they are subject to the same obligation - and that this access issue was a breach of the lease. Also, this is a rent-stabilized building.<br/><br/>Thank you for any input you're able to offer.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Greg</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionExpert"">Hello,<br/><br/><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">In the absence of a provision in your lease to the contrary, you would be subject to damages for the early termination of your lease but not necessarily the full balance of the payments.

This means that the landlord must use reasonable efforts to relet the property. In the event he is not able to relet the property, you will remain liable for the total amount of the lease payments. In the event the landlord is able to mitigate his damages and relet the property, you will be liable only for any shortfall between the new tenants lease and your lease. <br/> </span></p> <p class=""Msonormal"" style=""""><br/> </p> <p class=""Msonormal"" style=""""> </p><p class=""Msonormal"" style=""""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><br/></span></p> <p class=""Msonormal"" style=""""> </p> <p class=""Msonormal""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">I hope that I have fully answered your question and the answer was helpful to you.</span></p></div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionCustomer"">Hi,<br/><br/>Thank you for taking the time to answer the question. Is there any argument to be made that invasion of privacy does rise to the level of terminating a lease? Privacy in one's own residence is a fundamental right (and one of the few tenant rights actually protected in the lease). I felt very violated that they had accessed my apartment without permission afer insiting on being there. I understand the idea that termination of the lease represents financial damages to the Owner, and that a tenant's right to privacy isn't quantifiable, but could arguing that my privacy in my apartment as provided for in the lease is worth at least the value of the lease? It seems hugely one-sided that almost every provision in the lease is a protection of the Owner's interest and that when the wording is language is full of loopholes that it swings in favor of Owner, even in the even of Owner's breach of contract.<br/><br/>This is the provision in the lease that I believe allows me to make this argument in court.<br/>""If you do not do everything You agree to do in this Lease, Owner mayve have the right to end it before the above date. If Owner does not do everything that owner agrees to do in this Lease, You may have a right to end the Lease before ending date.""<br/><br/>I know this is really loopy language where ""may have the right"" could be argued many ways. The owner did not do everything they agreed to do in the lease (by failing to notify/seek my permission for access). I on the otherhand have followed every provision in the lease. I can't see how I don't have any grounds to make this argument.<br/><br/>Again, I really appreciate your time. I think I probably owe you some more money for this - I'll reload for another question once I figure out how this thing works. Am I completely doomed if I try to argue this before a judge?</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionExpert"">Hello,<br/><br/>It does not appear to be a valid argument since the action only occurred one time. When there is a breach of the lease, the non-breaching party needs to inform the breaching party of the breach and allow it to be cured.  In your situation, not repeating the entry would cure the breach.  You are certainly within your rights to make the argument, however it is not a likely argument to prevail on.<br/><br/>Sorry but I want to give you my honest opinion.<edited><editid>FLAandNYLawyer</editid><editdate>40092.6355400116</editdate></edited></div>]"

We are currently in the site selection stage and are facing a lot of zoning-related confusion. From the legal standpoint, hostels are treated essentially the same way as hotels. <br/><br/>So, we know that we are allowed to use Manufacturing-zoned properties for our use. However, this is where things become fuzzy.   <br/><br/>What are ALL of the zoning classifications that would permit a hostel use?   <br/><br/>Are there any restrictions with manufacturing-zoned buildings where we cannot open up?   <br/><br/>Are SROs (Single Occupancy Buildings) an option? Most of the hostels in NYC are run out of converted SROs, but there seems to have been a lot of pressure on the city from the low-income housing interest groups to get that changed. What exactly is going on? This just adds to the confusion: <strong>http://tinyurl.com/yd43udw</strong><br/><br/>We need to get a clear answer on what we can use, so we don't waste our time on other properties.

I've released the payment, so that it doesn't hold you up any longer.<br/><br/>Your answer was quite helpful, but there is still a big question that's unanswered: particularly regarding the SRO/residential buildings.<br/><br/>For example, in the article that I included earlier (http://www.tenant.net/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=7767&amp;sid=eb18944ed45ed799d79e902ca20f3400), it states that a portion of any residential building can be used as a transient hotel, as long as at least 50% of it remains residential.<br/><br/>Does that mean that if we select a residential building, we can rent  out 50% of it and turrn it into a hostel/bed-and-breakfast? For example, take a look at this building:<br/>XXXXX New York<br/><br/>It's a 3-story property, zoned C1-5. There is a store on the first floor and the other two are residential lofts. One floor is currently available for a lease. So... does that mean we can use it?

The article and the law make no distinction of what the 50% residential limit is--in other words, is that referring to the full building, or just to residential portions of the building.  In your case, if the top floor is residential loft, and the middle portion becomes a hostel, there will be <br/>a) More units and residences created, thus diluting the other residential properties.<br/>b) Create a minority of residential living, if the front space used for store fronts is lumped in with the city with the hostel living (then the percentage, even on bare square footage percentage becomes 33.3% residential and 66.6% other.<br/><br/>With your complicated issue and with your questions, you really need adequate representation (which I know you are searching for).

The termination notice need not specify why the landlord seeks possession of the apartment. Such notice does not automatically allow the landlord to evict the tenant. A landlord may raise the rent of a month-to-month tenant with the consent of the tenant. If the tenant does not consent, however, the landlord can terminate the tenancy by giving appropriate notice.

In CA. (our previous residence) (My husband was in the Navy) We were told we could have a 1 year lease. Our things were arriving on 04/01, so on03/31 when we were presented with a month to month offer we signed. The contract says we have to give 60 days notice but the owners only have to give 30 days. They seem like nice people but we want to feel more secure. Are we stuck? They contantly need to enter the basement for tools ect. and there is a manmade pond has about 1 foot of stagnent water right in the front yard. We were taken by surprise at the time also since we have a 12 yr old we needed a place to stay. we will be gratefull for any advice.</div>]","[<div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionExpert"">The landlord is obvioulsy someone who wants more than they give.  Under New York law, only 30 days notice is required to terminate a month-to-month tenancy.  If you are required to give 60 days notice, then it really isn't a month-to-month lease.  However, having agreed in writing to such notice, the situation is complicated.  I think you can get away with 30 days notice, but that doesn't really help you gain more security.  The point is that this is further illustration that your landlord is not acting fairly.<br/><br/>As the tenants, you are entitled to exlusive possession and quiet enjoyment of your property.  The landlord cannot enter your premises without reasonable notice, which is usually at least 24 hours.  A landlord cannot abuse that access by requesting it too often or by demanding access at unreasonable times.  You are entitled to be there when they enter.  You can refuse them entry unless those condition are met.  <br/><br/>If the stagnant water becomes an problem with mold and insects, it's possible that it can create a question about the habitability of the home.  There is also likely a local ordinance that deals with sources that harbor vermin such as mosquitos.  You might want to call your local code enforcement office to check this out.  You could require the landlord to remedy this situation.<br/><br/>All of these issues might give you some leverage in negotiation with the landlord.  However, they generally provide ammunition for early termination, not providing you with more security.<br/><br/>Given the actions of the landlord and the conditions you describe, the landlord sounds like one that will only create more headaches the longer your are there.  If it is security you want, I think you are best to find that elsewhere.  Even if you could secure a year lease with this person, there's a good chance it would simply be a year frought with difficulties.<br/><br/>Please let me know, if you have follow-up questions.<br/><br/> <p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""""><span style=""font-size: 9pt;"">The information is provided for discussion and entertainment purposes only.

I am not behind with my rent, since I was told I had until July 1st to move out. I did not pay my rent for the month of May&lt;/p&gt;</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionExpert"">Thank you for your reply.  I am afraid you are probably not going to like what I have to say, however, I want to make you aware of what the law is in New York.<br/><br/>Since you do not have a written lease, and your rent is due once a month, you have          a ""month-to-month tenancy"". The landlord can end your tenancy          by giving you a proper written or oral notice which tells you that your          tenancy will end on a specific date. In New York, if you are a month-to-month tenant, a new rental term occurs each month.          Under New York Law, <u>a landlord can only end your tenancy by giving you          one month's notice</u>. The date the tenancy ends must be the last day of          the term and it must be received by you before the beginning of the term.<br/><br/> <p>The beginning of the term of your tenancy is the date your rent is due.          The term ends on the day before the next time your rent is due. For example,          if your rent is due on the first of each month, that is the beginning          date of your rental term. The term would end on the last day of the prior          month. If your rent is due on the 15th of the month, that is the beginning          of your term. Your term would then end on the 14th day of the next month.</p><p> </p><p>The notice to terminate can be served in any manner. If the notice is          written, it can be mailed, put in the mailbox, handed to you or put under          your door. </p> <p>However, the notice to terminate does not have to be written. The landlord          can tell you that the tenancy will be ended on a certain date. He must          follow the law regarding the termination date and the date he gives you          notice.</p><p> </p>The landlord must still take you to court before you can be evicted legally should you decide not to move out after being given proper notice.          Only the court can decide that you are not entitled to live in the apartment.          And only the Sheriff can evict you after the landlord has taken you to          court and the court rules that you are not entitled to stay in the apartment. Since this is generally more of a hassle, I wouldn't generally suggest it. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, based on the limited facts you have given me, it appears that you were indeed given the proper one month's notice to vacate. The only real option you have is to see if the landlord will let you stay longer (because I agree, finding a new place to live in NYC, especially with young children, can be problematic), otherwise, you can hold over, and be evicted -though this will usually only buy you another week at best, XXXXX XXXXX result in your property being tossed to the curb and you being locked out of the premises. An eviction could also impact your chances of finding a new place to live.<br/><br/>I am sorry to tell you this, but that is the law in New York.

What can I do?<br/>My landlord refuses to make repairs to my apartment. What can I do?<br/>Can my landlord enter my apartment at any time?<br/>My landlord has changed the locks on my apartment. Is the landlord allowed to change my locks?<br/>What can I do?<br/>I received a notice from my landlord. What should I do?<br/>What is a Notice to Cure?

I think it is too high. What can I do?<br/>Am I entitled to have my apartment painted?<br/>What is the City's law about lead-based paint?<br/>What are the rules about living in basements and cellars?<br/>The landlord says that a carbon monoxide detecting device must be installed in my apartment and that I must pay for it.<br/>Am I supposed to get my security deposit back?<br/>What are my responsibilities as a tenant?<br/>I see drugs being sold in my building. What can I do?<br/>What should I do if my building owner is harassing me?<br/>Can a building owner discriminate against me?<br/>Can I have pets in my apartment?<br/>How do I contact HPD for more information?<br/>How can I give feedback about the HPD website?<br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>I have no heat or hot water in my apartment. What can I do?<br/>By law, residential owners must provide adequate heat between October 1 and May 31. During this period, between 6:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m., if the outside temperature is below 55 degrees Fahrenheit, owners must heat apartments to at least 68 degrees Fahrenheit. Between 10:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m., if the outside temperature is below 40 degrees Fahrenheit, owners must heat apartments to at least 55 degrees Fahrenheit. Owners must also provide hot water at a minimum constant temperature of 120 degrees Fahrenheit all year round.<br/>Tenants whose building owners fail to provide adequate heat or hot water should first speak with the owner or building manager about the problem. If an owner does not restore heat and hot water, tenants should then call the City's Citizen Service Center at 311, open 24 hours per day, seven days per week, to lodge a complaint (311 can be accessed outside of New York City by dialing (212) NEW YORK).<br/>My landlord refuses to make repairs to my apartment. What can I do?<br/>If you are a tenant in a privately-owned building, there are several things you can do to get their landlord to make repairs; however, you may want to take the following steps in order to establish a record:<br/> <br/>Contact the building superintendent regarding the repairs. <br/>If the superintendent or management company does not respond, write a letter to the owner of the building that describes the problems in your apartment and asks for the repairs to be made by a certain date. You should send the letter to the owner and management company by certified mail and keep a copy for your records. <br/>If you do not receive a response to the letter, you should try to contact the owner in person or by phone. Let him or her know that if the repairs are not completed, that the tenant will have to file a complaint. Keep a record of all of your attempts to get the landlord to make repairs, as this will be useful in court. <br/>If the owner still does not respond or fails to provide essential services, you may report the condition to the City's Citizen Service Center at 311 (311 may be accessed outside New York City by dialing (212) NEW YORK). For the hearing impaired, the TTY number is (XXX) XXX-XXXX. The Center is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week.<br/>You can also bring a case against the landlord in Housing Court to get an order to correct the conditions. This case is called an HP Action. HP actions are lawsuits brought by tenants or groups of tenants against landlords to force them to make repairs and provide essential services, like heat and hot water. A landlord's failure to make a repair or provide an important service may be a violation of the New York City Housing Maintenance Code or the Multiple Dwelling Law. In an HP action, a judge can order the landlord to correct the violations. If you want to start an HP proceeding against your landlord, go to the Clerk's Office at the Housing Court. You do not need a lawyer to start an HP case.<br/>Tenants living in an HPD-owned building who have complaints about the maintenance of their apartment should call XXX-XXX-XXXX or 311.<br/>Tenants in rent controlled or rent stabilized apartments may contact the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR) Office of Rent Administration. Call 311 for information. DHCR may impose penalties on building owners in the form of rent reductions if a tenant's problems are valid.<br/>Tenants with maintenance complaints about apartments in New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) buildings should go to their management office and fill out a work ticket.<br/> <br/>[back to top]<br/>Can my landlord enter my apartment at any time?<br/>Generally no. However, a landlord may enter a tenant's apartment in some situations. For example, generally, the landlord can enter your apartment:<br/> <br/>At a reasonable time after providing reasonable notice if the entry is either <br/>To provide necessary or agreed upon repairs or services, or <br/>In accordance with the lease, or <br/>To show the apartment to prospective tenants or purchasers; and <br/>In an emergency, at any time and without notice. <br/>[back to top]<br/>My landlord has changed the locks on my apartment. Is the landlord allowed to change my locks?<br/>Changing the locks on an resident's apartment without giving the resident a key would be a violation of the Unlawful Eviction Law (NYC Administrative Code §26-521) if:<br/> <br/>The resident is: <br/>A tenant or subtenant with a lease, <br/>An occupant who has lawfully lived in the apartment for more than thirty days (with or without the lease), <br/>A subtenant, roommate or relative who has lived in the apartment for at least thirty days (even if the person is not on the lease and has not made any direct payments to the landlord),</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionExpert"">I am familiar with this law.  My answer stands.</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionCustomer"">&lt;p&gt;Ask FLAandNYLawyer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Would your answer be the same if he were here 25 days?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If so you, me and the local police obviously all have a problem  understanding the law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because I know of so many cases where a person that didn't live somewhere for 30 days was in fact thrown in the street by the police at the REQUEST not court order of the rentor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now I see why there is so much confusion in courts, be in Landlord/tenant, civil, criminal etc. It seems to all boil down to interpretation and the one with the best presentation. THE written laws are obviously useless and only there to confuse people. Again I know for a fact (it happened to me out in suffolk county over 15 years ago) as well as having someone I know get thrown out about 1 and 1/2 months ago. So if you can explain why you stick to your original answer I will gladly pay the fee and reccomend you as someone who knows the law better then the books do.  tHANK YOU&lt;/p&gt;</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionCustomer"">I do not accept this answer It was wrong. Local police came LAST NIGHT (30TH DAY) and had said roommate leave and take his belongings.<br/>That is NYC Law as I pointed out in DHCR document I copied and pasted my question was a technicallity of whether the 30th day counted and I was told that it would be the same on the 25th day. This is entirely wrong and misleading to someone that doesn't know anything about the law. I am disappointed but not surprised at how misinformed even an expert is</div>]"

It is not usually considered as rent.  If you look at your lease, there's probably a provision that says the deposit is not to be used as rent.  </p><p> </p><p>This being the case, you could run into some trouble doing this - especially if the lease says what I assume it does. </p><p> </p><p>The worst case scenario is that you don't pay rent, you get evicted or leave after 2 months, and you also don't get your security deposit back because the landlord had to use the money to make repairs to the space.  The landlord could sue you for the rent and keep the deposit.  You'll be out twice as much if this happens.</p><p> </p><p>My suggestion is to pay the rent and demand the security deposit to be returned, less any necessary deductions for repairs, under New York law. </p><p> </p><p>In New York, the landlord must return the security deposit, less any lawful deduction, to the tenant at the end of the lease or <strong>within a reasonable time thereafter</strong>. A landlord may use the security deposit: (a) as reimbursement for the reasonable cost of repairs beyond normal wear and tear, if the tenant damages the apartment; or (b) as reimbursement for any unpaid rent. </p><p> </p><p>New York Landlords, regardless of the number of units in the building, must treat the deposits as trust funds belonging to their tenants and they may not co-mingle deposits with their own money. Landlords of buildings with six or more apartments must put all security deposits in New York bank accounts earning interest at the prevailing rate. </p><p> </p><p>Each tenant in New York must be informed in writing of the bank's name and address and the amount of the deposit. </p><p> </p><p>Landlords are entitled to annual administrative expenses of 1% of the deposit. All other interest earned on the deposits belongs to the tenants. Tenants must be given the option of having this interest paid to them annually, applied to rent, or paid at the end of the lease term. If the building has fewer than six apartments, a landlord who voluntarily places the security deposits in an interest bearing bank account must also follow these rules. For example: A tenant pays a security deposit of $400. The landlord places the deposit in an interest bearing bank account paying 2.5%. At the end of the year the account will have earned interest of $10.00. The tenant is entitled to $6.00 and the landlord may retain $4.00, 1% of the deposit, as an administrative fee. All figures subject to change. </p><p>If the building is sold, the landlord must transfer all security deposits to the new owner within five days, or return the security deposits to the tenants. Landlords must notify the tenants, by registered or certified mail, of the name and address of the new owner. Purchasers of rent stabilized buildings are directly responsible to tenants for the return of security deposits and any interest. This responsibility exists whether or not the new owner received the security deposits from the former landlord. </p><p>Purchasers of rent-controlled buildings or buildings containing six or more apartments where tenants have written leases are directly responsible to tenants for the return of security deposits and interest in cases where the purchaser has ""actual knowledge"" of the security deposits. The law defines specifically when a new owner is deemed to have ""actual knowledge"" of the security deposits.

Would-be tenant returned signed lease by email, but called to withdraw shortly thereafter.</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionExpert"">The actual payment is not required to make the contract enforceable.  I think you are referring to the general rule that a contract must have three main elements in order to be in force -- there must be an offer (there was -- you offered to rent), there must be acceptance (there was, they accepted and signed and returned the lease) and there must be consideration (there is -- you are giving them access to the rental unit, they are agreeing to pay). <br/><br/>At this point, if the funds were due upon signing, then, it sounds like they have breached the agreement.   When they called to withdraw, that alone does not let them out of the obligation.  <br/><br/>It does, however, put you on notice of their intent not to perform on the lease.  At that point you should: <br/><br/>1) make it clear to them that you do not intend to let them off the lease (if that is the case); <br/>2) demand immediate payment; <br/>3) since they have not moved in, tell them that you intend to release the property if you don't receive the rent by some date soon  but make it clear that you will hold them responsible for the difference between the amount you agreed to lease it to them for and the amount you actually get (after deducting reasonable expenses like re-advertising.)  This is called ""covering"".  When someone breaches an agreement (which it sounds like they are), you can't just sit around and let the damages (in the form of lost rent) continue and take no action and then sue them later.  You have to take reasonable steps to minimize the damages.  That is called covering.  Since they have not moved in and if they continue to refuse to pay, I think it would be reasonable to rerent the property in order to cover but you should do that only after you have given them an opportunity to fix their breach (i.e., make the payment.)  Otherwise, next thing that will happen is that you will have rerented it and they will decide they want it. <br/><br/></div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionCustomer"">My friend is the would-be tenant; so the landlord has a duty to mitigate damages?</div>, <div class=""QNAThreadItemDescriptionExpert"">In general, all contracts require reasonable steps to mitigate.  <br/><br/>I am not sure why your friend being the would be tenant plays into the issue as a legal matter.  Certainly, it may play into the issue as a practical matter.  Hopefully, your friend will value the friendship and play fair -- and, obviously, hopefully you will as well.  But, as a legal issue, I don't see it mattering.  If your friend signed a legally binding agreement (which it sounds like they did) and you want to enforce it, you are within your rights to do so.  And, that includes demanding payment.  And, if they refuse to pay, that includes bringing a lawsuit to enforce the payment obligation.  But, it also requires that you don't sit back and let the damages accrue and do nothing to protect yourself from further damage.  <br/><br/>I think the need to mitigate is even stronger where your friend is involved.  Clearly, you will be hesitant to sue your friend.  So, your chances of recovering money later are reduced.  And, clearly, the communication channel should be there so the two of you can find a way to agree that the friend won't try to get the property later (so you are free to rerent it) and that the friend gives you some compensation (for lost rent, expenses, etc.)  In fact, maybe you could just agree upfront that you will lose $X in rent and $Y in expenses and that you will let the friend out of the lease and the friend will pay you $X + $Y or some portion of that. <br/><br/>I will add, in many cases of rentals, it is hard to mitigate damages by rerenting because the tenant is in the property.  But, here, it sounds like that is not the issue. <br/></div>]"

The spouse gets $50k + 1/2 the estate and the children would split the rest.  (this is despite them being estranged.  He would need to create  a will to rule them out).<br/><br/>If he does have a will that does not provide for you, then you have another remedy.<br/>Under New York law, you have what is called the ""Elective Share Statute"".  This is the law that provides protection to the spouse when they is no will, or they are not provided for substantially in any will.<br/><br/>[5-1.1-A]  Provides either the greater of $50k, or 1/3 of the estate.<br/><br/>There is no automatic right you get to keep the home as there are children involved.  HOWEVER  you will be able to successfully argue that the home is part yours through a martial acquisition, and constructive trust.    So a portion of the value of the home will apply to you before the calculation of the value of the estate.<br/><br/>If there is a divorce you have an equitable interest in the property, so him leaving your name off the deed does not impact your rights to part of it in the event of a divorce.<br/><br/>Having no will is a very bad idea.

Tell him this is just to account for the bills that you paid.  On the balance sheet put your deposit, and reference that you now have rent paid until XX date.<br/><br/>It is against the law for him to change the locks.

If you have mail going there, and any proof of paying rent, then the police will see right through it.  Your address on your drivers license will help.<br/><br/>If he tries to use the letter against you with the police you will be able to sue him for malicious prosecution.

Under New York Law, the landlord may only withhold owed amounts from past rents/fees, and damages above normal wear and tear.<br/><br/>Secondly it is New York Law that the landlord must not co-mingle the deposit money with their own money, to ensure the deposits are available when they are to be returned.<br/><br/>It appears as if you are entitled to the $5000.  <br/><br/>Confirm with your paperwork about the lease and the term is clear. i.e. that it does expire in Oct, and that the deposit is just that, a deposit.  I must say it is a very high deposit.<br/><br/>Because of the amount involved, and the potential for special damages I would advise that you contact the DHCR.  (Division of Housing and Community Renewal).  <br/><p><strong>Downtown Office:</strong> <br/>Gertz Plaza <br/>92-31 Union Hall Street <br/>Jamaica, new York 11433 (NNN) NNN-NNNN</p>Tell them you are a month to month hold over, and the landlord is refusing to cooperate with your notice to quit.   They will give you the proper contacts and steps for your area in how to proceed.<br/><br/>Based on your fact pattern you have been diligent, and I see no reason why you wont recover the deposit.  Further if it is held over in bad faith, you have the rights to damages.<br/><br/>If this helps please click ACCEPT.  You may follow up if needed.<br/><br/>Regards</div>]"
